## Freelance web designer. I design and build WordPress-powered websites for individuals and small businesses

My name is David peach and I am a freelance web designer living in Tamworth, Staffordshire. I design and build future-friendly websites that look and work great across the wide range of todayâ€™s connected devices.

As well as designing and building websites, I also build [plugins](http://web.archive.org/web/20140922071944/http://davidpeach.co.uk/plugins/) for both WordPress and OpenCart, as well as sharing things I find and learn in my [blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20140922071944/http://davidpeach.co.uk/blog/).

Outside of the web I enjoy a vast array of music and am currently catching up on TV series that people were raving about ten years ago.
