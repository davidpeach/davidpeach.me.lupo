Every WordPress user knows that a fresh install of WordPress comes with a plugin called 'Hello Dolly'.

Hello Dolly places a random lyric from the song of the same name at the top right of the admin area, changing with each new admin page load.

I like the idea but am not really a fan of the song. So I thought it would be cool to do my own variation. I have called it 'Hello Seagal'.

Hello Seagal does exactly what Hello Dolly does -- in fact it uses the original code from Hello Dolly -- but altered for my needs. Hello Seagal will place a random line from various [Steven Seagal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Seagal) Films in the top right of your admin area, changing with each page load.

With such classic lines as:

- "I'm gonna take you to the bank, Senator Trent" from Hard to Kill

- "Anybody know why Richie did Bobby Lupo?" from Above the Law AKA Out for Justice

- "I'm just a cook" from Under Siege
