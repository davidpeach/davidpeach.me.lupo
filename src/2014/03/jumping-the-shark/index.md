The term jumping the shark, I discovered today, is an idiom that is a way of describing when a television show's quality begins to decline. It originated from the television show Happy Days in its season five premiere, where The Fonz literally jumped over a contained shark on a beach front.

This was quite a step away from its usual family and adolescent related story lines set against the nostalgia of the 1950s.

> The usage of "jump the shark" has subsequently broadened beyond television, indicating the moment when a brand, design, or creative effort's evolution declines.
