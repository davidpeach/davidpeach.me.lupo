I love WordPress. I love how whatever it is you want to add into your site, you can pretty much guarantee that a plugin has been made to do just that. I have recently been getting into the IndieWeb and have installed a number of great plugins that have helped me do just that. However there are still a couple of things that niggle at me. The main one at this point in time is using twitter. Now I am on the IndieWeb bandwagon, I write all my 'Tweets' as status posts on my site first — they then get shared to twitter; or Facebook or even Flickr. The thing with using Twitter directly is that it is such an easy interface to use. And when writing on my site first there are certain configurations to be done for each message:

- Setting the format to status

- Setting the category to Note

- Setting the permalink and title for the status

What I want is an indieweb implementation that could at least match Twitter's easy of use. And not only that, but for other social networks as well. So with that being said, I think I am going to have a go at writing my own custom C.M.S. from scratch. I have wanted a nice side project to work on for a while now — one that isn't my own personal site — and an IndieWeb-focused C.M.S. could be just the thing. Of course, I do go through fits and spurts of ideas I want to make so if I get any of you excited and don't follow through, I apologize. However I will do my best to follow this one through.
