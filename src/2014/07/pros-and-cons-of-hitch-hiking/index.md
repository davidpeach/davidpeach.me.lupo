Today I rediscovered one of my all-time favourite albums — Roger Waters' The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking.

Although known mostly for his work with British Rock band Pink Floyd, some of Roger's best work — in my opinion — was in his solo albums. Though to be fair his Pink Floyd work is incredible.

The concept, as envisioned by Waters in 1977, rotated around a man's scattered thoughts during a road trip through somewhere in Central Europe, focusing on his midlife crisis, and how he dreams of committing adultery with a hitchhiker he picks up along the way.

Along the way he also faces other fears and paranoia, with all of these things taking place in real time in the early morning hours of 4:30am to 5:12am on an unspecified day.

> The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking -- This concept album was offered to the rest of Pink Floyd along with the early concept for The Wall. The band went on to do The Wall and Roger completed Pros and Cons in 1983 as a solo piece.

It features great guitar work from none other than [Eric Clapton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton) as well as featuring [Jack Palance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Palance), who takes on the role of the Hell's Angel in the story.

To be honest you could do yourself a favour and listen to anything that Roger Waters has created.
