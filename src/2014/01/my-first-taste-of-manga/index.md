I have recently been introduced to the wonderful world of Japanese Manga by some friends at work.

I hear mentioned things such as a school with Freddie Mercury as a pupil, humans who turn into cars and people becoming obsessed and consumed by spirals.

But the story that set me on the path of reading manga was [The Enigma of Amigara Fault](http://web.archive.org/web/20150505075241/http://scans-daily.dreamwidth.org/4530971.html) - a haunting Lovecraft-esque story written by [Junji Ito](http://web.archive.org/web/20150505075241/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junji_Ito).
