I have recently been introduced to the wonderful world of Japanese Manga by some friends at work. I hear mentioned things such as a school with Freddie Mercury as a pupil, humans who turn into cars and people becoming obsessed and consumed by spirals. But the story that set me on the path of reading manga was The Enigma of Amigara Fault - a haunting Lovecraft-esque story written by Junji Ito.
