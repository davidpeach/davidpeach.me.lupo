On Friday 11th April my Girlfriend and I drove down to London for the weekend. It was a great weekend, with the nucleus of this trip was to see [Chrysta Bell](http://www.chrystabell.com/) on her tour.

## Who is Chrysta Bell?

Chrysta Bell is an artist in the truest sense of the word. Her voice is one of those that **can both charm and haunt you.** She commands the performance with such force that it is difficult to explain in mere words. You really need to experience it first hand.

She was touring on the back of an album produced and co-written by [David Lynch](http://www.davidlynch.com/). David Lynch is definitely present in both the album and on the night itself, but this isn't just a case of "David Lynch produced it, therefore it's awesome". The album _is_ awesome, believe me, but it is due to the **equal talents of both David and Chrysta combined**. Each on their own are unique and hugely talented, but **together they produce something even more special**.

I first heard Chrysta Bell in a song from David Lynch's film Inland Empire. The song Polish Poem was used in the film to such a haunting effect. As soon as I found out about the Album they did together This Train, which Polish Poemfeatures on, I was immediately hooked on the music they were making together.

## The Gig Itself

The gig itself was out of this world. Anyone who has seen Twin Peaks would be hard-pressed not to imagine themselves stood in the Road House, watching Chrysta in front of that red curtain. At least that's how it was for me.

**Her vocals were both soothing and haunting**, with the melodies weaving throughout the crowd. Her band were great also. Chrysta, of course, was centre stage, but the band weren't just a faceless few who played the music. The four of them as a whole played the songs with **a firm understanding of each other's rhythms and timing**.

The performances that stood out for me were Swing with Me and a new song they played, the name of which I can't remember. The only song that wasn't performed that I would have loved to have heard live was Polish Poem. I can only imagine what that would have felt like. The venue did have a 10pm curfew, so maybe Polish Poem would have been performed without the time restriction.

## After The Show

When the show was finished I was both happy and sad. Sad because a great show had come to an end, but happy because **my Girlfriend and I got to meet Chrysta face to face.** I had previously spoken to Chrysta over twitter and I arranged to buy her earlier album, Bitter Pills and Delicacies, directly from her. after the show.

From my own conversations with Chrysta, **it is obvious that she cares deeply for her fans.** I wasn't surprised to see her mingling with the fans both before and after the show.

Thanks, Chrysta.
