On the 16th October this year I will be taking part in my second half-marathon. This will be the same route in Birmingham, UK.  
The last time I did it, which was last year, I managed to strain my knee whilst training as I tried running too far, too fast, too soon.  
This time I am going to be following an 8-week training guide, building myself up slowly and hopefully beating my previous time of 2 hours 16 minutes.
