I can’t tell you how happy I was when I heard that Priest were releasing this new song.

“We’re The Same” has that signature “Priest” sound that I have come to love from their eponymous debut album. It sounds as though Madeline is pushing her voice further in this song – and to powerful effect. The chorus roars with her voice and the musical arrangements expertly produced by co-member David Kazyk.

The familiar blanket of Priest’s unique soundscapes perfectly envelope the song’s words and melody, making for a very welcome addition to their catalogue.

It is also really nice of them to release it as a free download on SoundCloud.

Big thanks to Madeline and David!
