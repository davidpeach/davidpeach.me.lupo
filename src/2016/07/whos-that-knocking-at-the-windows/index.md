So yesterday I rage-quitted Windows 10 for its constant blue-screening.  
None of my games would work under the Linux distro I installed.  
So now I have re-installed Windows 10 with the vain hope of it working fine.

One thing I didn't actually think about during my immature rage yesterday, was to debug the issue - first with the hardware. So apparently RAM is a major contributor towards the Blue Screen Of Death, as it is affectionately known, so I thought that would be a good place to start.

At the time of writing I have hoovered out my pc base, removed and blew dust from the ram slots, then re-installed. I also disabled the CPU unlock in my BIOS due to a new warning on my P.C. during boot.  
So far no blue has been seen.

I'll keep you posted as the story develops.
