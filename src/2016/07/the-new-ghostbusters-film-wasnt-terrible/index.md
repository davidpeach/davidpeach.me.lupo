When I first saw the trailer to this film I had the same thoughts as many fans of the original film - "oh great, another classic film that somebody's gonna kill off". But I went to see it today based on the positive reviews I'd seen and do you know what? I actually enjoyed the film.

While I still love the original film way more than the new one, the new film did have many good points to it. One of which was a surprise role played by [Jared from Silicon Valley](https://www.buzzfeed.com/davids4ca892eac/14-reasons-everyone-loves-jared-dunn-from-hbos-s-16z4a).

One thing I couldn't help but notice though was the annoying inclusion of cameos from the original cast throughout as well as one certain rock personality. These cameos actually took me out of this film's experience albeit for a moment - all just to appease die-hard fans no doubt.

Also I couldn't help but notice how the only woman without qualifications and scientific knowledge was the sassy stereotyped black woman. Maybe I'm looking to deep into it but It's something that did stick out a bit.

But all in all I did actually enjoy the film. It was a funny Saturday night movie with a few jumps and lots of funny moments throughout.
