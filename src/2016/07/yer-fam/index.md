Like Matth-ew - With sweep and sooty.  
I got you in my hand -- You're putty.  

You're innocent like a snowdrop  
You're wet round the ear like a raindrop  
You're often broke like a film prop  
If you're feeling harassed then call the cops --  

-- but I'm above the law; I'm Nico  
You're family friendly; You're Chico.  
You're just about as reliable as my old fridge, Beco!
