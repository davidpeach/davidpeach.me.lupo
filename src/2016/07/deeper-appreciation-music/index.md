As I'm writing this current review, of Bat For Lashes' latest album, I'm realising that I'm gaining a deeper understanding of the songs than I would have done simply from just listening to them.  

I'm finding myself focusing and even studying the music and the lyrics and feel like I'm getting so much more out of the album.  

I have noticed it before with other albums I've reviewed recently, but it's with this one - and specifically the song "In God's House", that I've have really noticed it.
