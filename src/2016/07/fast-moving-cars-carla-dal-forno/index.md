This single, and indeed its accompanying song, "Better Yet", is one of the nicest musical surprises I've had recently. I'd never heard of Carla Dal Forno before stumbling upon the song "Fast Moving Cars".

The songs on here are so wonderfully bleak, especially "Better Yet". I don't know what it is about the atmosphere that these songs have, or what feelings they evoke, all I know is I can not wait for her debut album.
