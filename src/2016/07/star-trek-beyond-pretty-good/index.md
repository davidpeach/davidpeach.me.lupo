Today me and my good lady went to see the new Star Trek film, Star Trek: Beyond. I had no expectations for it - I was neither excited or anticipating it to be bad; I just went and watched a film at the cinema. And as it turned outÂ I enjoyed it.

This film felt like it was intentionally going for a low-key feel. By that I don't mean it was boring or poorly made - it just felt like they weren't trying to make a huge blockbuster; just an enjoyable night out at the cinema. And that, it was.

I especially loved the little twist at the start with Kirk delivering an item to a vicious-looking alien race. I wont spoil it for you but it did make me chuckle.

So yer, the new Star Trek - pretty good. Take your loved ones for some unapologetic space-roaming fun.
