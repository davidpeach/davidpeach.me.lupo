My fish and chips have just arrived.

Currently sat in Sainsbury's cafe once again. My nectar points are gonna be through the roof by Christmas.

I'm thinking about restarting the ecommerce CMS I started for my last 100 days attempt. Except this time not part of the 100 days. Cant help thinking it's a waste of time as there are already so many. But if I treat it as a learning curve, then it will have some benefit.

Randomly thought about how far we've come with technology and yet I'm sat here stirring my tea with a wooden stick.
