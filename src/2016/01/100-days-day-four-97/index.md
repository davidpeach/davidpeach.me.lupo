Slept in till 10:40.

In the early afternoon we went for a run around Kingsbury Water Park. A load of the water's-edge trees have been cut down, not sure why though. When we got there it was nice to see that the car park was pretty empty - no masses of people to avoid when doing our laps.

Later on, after getting caught up with the new X Files series, Lizzie cleaned out and changed Moomin while I washed up and Cooked the tea.

I'm quite impressed with myself in keeping up this 100 days so far.
