Today I saw possibly the worst film of my life - Dirty Grampa - at Vue, Star City.

I think in parts the humour actually offended me. I couldn't believe this was the same guy I'd seen in Jackie Brown.

On a more positive note, me and Liz did go for a nice meal at the Green Man in Middleton. My only quarm was that my otherwise nice burger came on a bloody brioche bun.

Then on the evening we watched the first episode of the new series of The X Files. Despite the mixed reviews I actually liked it.
