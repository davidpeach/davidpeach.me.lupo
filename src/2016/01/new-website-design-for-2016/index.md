I have finally launched the redesign for my personal website.

There's nothing much different in the layout -- it was more about the back-end structure than trying to come up with a fancy new front-end design.

Overall I'm happy with it. Now I just need to add back in the little extras I added before, such as posting via SMS form my phone, and queuing the jobs up into background tasks. But as it is now, it seems to me to be a much better experience from the front end.

I started to find my previous version hard to look at and hard to read. Hopefully the same wont happen with this one.
