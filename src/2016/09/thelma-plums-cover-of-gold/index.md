When I hear a new artist or song that I love, I sort of get obsessed and replay it over and over. It then becomes part of my regular playlist.

It is rare that a song will come along that literally makes me stop what I’m doing completely, and just focus in on it. Thelma Plum’s cover of Chet Faker’s Gold did this to me.

I really can’t put into words the feelings I get listening to this. It is such a perfect performance that you just need to listen to it.
