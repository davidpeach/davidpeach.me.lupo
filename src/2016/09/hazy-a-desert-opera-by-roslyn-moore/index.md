Like people who remember where they were when JFK was killed, or Princess Diana, I remember exactly where and when I first heard [Hazy (A Desert Opera) by Roslyn Moore](https://soundcloud.com/roslyn-moore/sets/hazy-a-desert-opera).

I was in that midway state of consciousness between awake and asleep, listening to this album. I was enjoying it as an overall experience as my dozing in and out hindered my ability to latch on to the songs. That was until one song in particular stood up and smacked me in the face. That song was "Drama Queen". It is fucking awesome. In fact I tweeted that exact thought right out then and there.

## A manifesto for love's losers

I imagine that this album was very cathartic for Roslyn to make. I know nothing about her personally, but the music comes across so personally and emotionally that it just has to come from somewhere real.

When I listen to the songs here I don't feel down at all. I mean, I can imagine people listening to this music in completely different frames of mind. Perhaps you need music to enhance your depression; perhaps to need comfort to remind you that you're not alone. For me, I see the beauty that has come out of pain and made something that the world needs - real, honest, art.

> Hazy is a brutal manifesto for loves losers. That person willing to take a bullet for passion. At its best, Hazy is ride off the cliff hand in hand music.

Each song on Hazy (A Desert Opera) is completely unique to me. No one song bleeds into another and every song has its own idiosyncrasy that makes it stand out from the next.

"Malibu" is as great an album introduction as they come. It's hard to talk about sadcore without somehow thinking of Lana Del Rey, but I got that sort of vibe in this song. But I also got reminded slightly of the singer from a band I used to listen to called Jack Off Jill.

When presented with a new artist I often can't help but draw initial comparisons to other artists I like. But if I grow to like that new artist the comparison soon goes away. Before the end of Malibu the comparison was gone - I was officially a fan of Roslyn Moore.

The next song, "The Burbs", is where I fell in love with the album. While writing this post, I focused in on the words of this song and found I could vividly picture the song's story in my mind's eye. I couldn't help but see the scenes play out in a Twin Peaks-esque town. A picture perfect idealistic town with a dark underbelly of taboo hidden just beneath the surface.

Or am I just thinking about it too much? - I don't think so. The great thing about music, and art in general, is that every receiver's opinion is valid.

I love the lyrics to the next song, "XO":

> someone cool like you  
> who tastes like you and smells like you  
> and fucks like you  
> someone who talks like you  
> and kisses like you and smiles like you  
> I really really need someone cool like you  
> who moves like you and plays guitar like you  
> and looks like you  
> someone cool like you  
> someone cool like you
> 
> XO by Roslyn Moore

I couldn't mention a couple of songs with mentioning "Drama Queen". The flow of this song just blows me away every time I hear it. The transitions between the song's sections are so greatly done. How her voice and the accompaniment come together perfectly in the following passage just grabs me:

> every time I close my eyes  
> I can see you in my dreams  
> I can see you through the lines  
> telling me baby, you're such a drama queen
> 
> Drama Queen by Roslyn Moore
