It's always a risky undertaking when trying to re-make a classic film such as Ben Hur. I don't have many memories of the original, in fact I only watched the first two thirds of it. I guess I never got round to finishing it.

The original Ben Hur was a full-on epic, clocking in at a little over three and a half hours. Because of this, and the sheer scale of the film for its time, it will always stand out as a classic. The new remake, however, didn't really have the epic feeling of its original. It didn't even feel like anything that special. What it was though, was an enjoyable two hour film that will hopefully make you more forgiving to your fellow man / woman.

This remake has a lot of good messages to take away from it and I thought the acting was pretty good too. Just don't be expected to be taken on a three and a half hour epic journey.Â I don't think most of today's audiences would have the _patience_ for three and a half hours of film. In fact I've found that people can't go ten minutes without checking their bloody phones.

Idiots. Rant over.

If you've not seen the 1959 classic I think you'll enjoy it. If you _have_ seen the original, and have a certain fondness for it, you may leave feeling slightly deflated. But as I always say, go and see for yourself.
