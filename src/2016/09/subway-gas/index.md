I'm gonna get gassed  
Gonna break the peace,  
All I want is a nice sub sandwich  
with meat and lettuce and peas.

When I get gassed  
I'll be shouting "eff you".  
But for now I'll mind my p's and q's,  
So I'll wait patiently for my peas, and queue.

Stuck in this place with money to spend  
Seems this queuing ting is a new fad trend.  
Like Pokemon, can't you kids just "go"?  
I'm stacking these P's; here look, I'll show

I'll make it rain,  
Bringing in da pain.  
I'm a knock you off track  
like a dis-railed train.
