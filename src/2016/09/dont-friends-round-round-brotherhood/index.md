I have been a big fan of both Kidulthood and Adulthood for a while now. I got really excited when I saw a bus drive past me recently with a big picture of Noel Clarke on the side. The only word I could make out as the bus sped past was "Brotherhood".

## Realistic and brutal with some tasteful comedy

Tonight I went to see "Brotherhood" and I was not disappointed whatsoever. This film was terrific - often grimey; always believable; and even occasionally really funny. There is a great scene in the film regarding a phone conversation and Sainsbury's. That's all I'll say, but the whole cinema screen was in stitches at this bit.

There were other elements of comedy now and again that offset the serious drama really well. Never cheesy or fake, in fact it was like a light cushion to soften the blows of the harsh world that Sam Peel lives in.

This harsh world of West London gangs and crime was represented really well. I mean, I have zero knowledge of the world that the characters live in, but there were never any points that felt forced or fake. Every scene felt believable and was at times very brutal.

## I left feeling uplifted

Despite the brutality of some of the film's scenes and emotional turmoil that the characters went through, I left the cinema feeling uplifted. And speaking about emotional turmoil, Noel Clarke's performance in particular was impressive. He plays as both vulnerable and as a bad ass during "Brotherhood", and in both his performance is stand out.

It's probably worth mentioning that there were no bad performances here. All were great, I just don't want this write up to be massive, as it would be if I was to give all praise to where praise was due.

How this film got a '15' certificate I'll never know. The C-bomb got dropped and I lost count of the amount of times I saw full-frontal nudity - men and women. I guess things have changed since I was a lad...

... gosh did I just say that?

Anyway, "Brotherhood" is an awesome film to be enjoyed as both a final chapter to the "hood" trilogy (Kidulthood, Adulthood, Brotherhood), or even as a film on its own. It's been at least two or three years since I saw the previous two films and I still thoroughly enjoyed this one.
