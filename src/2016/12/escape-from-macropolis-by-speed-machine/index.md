Today’s entry into the 33 days of Synthwave is “Escape from Macropolis” by Speed Machine. I was immediately transfixed to this song as soon as I heard the Escape From New York samples used throughout. And they are so expertly used too, especially when Donald Pleasence’s “You are the Duke of New York” line is used. Excellent stuff.
