Growing up, one of my scariest moments was seeing Halloween 3: Season of the Witch. Halloween has turned out to be a big influence on my now-grown-up tastes. I mean, I don’t have urges to kill anybody, but I do have urges to listen to awesome dark synth music and watch the occasion film that will scare the crap out of me.

Today’s Synthwave song is “Halloween Theme Rework” by Perturbator. Enjoy.
