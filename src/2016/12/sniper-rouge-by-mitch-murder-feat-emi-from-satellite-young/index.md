Synthwave isn’t the only music I’ve re-discovered recently. I have also been listening to J-pop again. There’s something about listening to music where I don’t understand the language that makes me feel cultured.

Imagine my surprise when I discovered a Synthwave group from Japan called “Satellite Young”. Today’s song is actually by Mitch Murder, but features the singer from Satellite Young – “Emi Kusano”. I will be listening to more of Satellite Young’s music and no doubt it will feature in my 100 days.
