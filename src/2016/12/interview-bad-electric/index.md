One of my favourite synth artists of recent times is [Bad Electric](https://badelectric.bandcamp.com/releases). His E.P. LUX, which [I wrote about previously](https://davidpeach.co.uk/2016/12/21/lux-e-p-by-bad-electric/), is still in my regular circulation.

I reached out to him this week on SoundCloud about answering some of my questions. Below you can read the answers to those questions and get to know him a bit more.

## The Interview

Please tell us about yourself in as many or as little words as you like.

I'm a grumpy guy who grew up in rural Pennsylvania during the 1980s . I work in contemporary art galleries in NYC and make music out of my home studio in Brooklyn.

Growing up, who were your heroes in music?

No one in my family was into music when I was a kid. My dad sort-of liked Phil Collins and made a point of it whenever Phil or a Genesis song came on the radio. My Mum had a weird thing for Michael Bolton. My older sisters were jamming Tiffany and Debbie Gibson. I wouldn't be exposed to good music until junior high when my friend lent me a Pink Floyd mix tape his older brother had made. Later, my goth uncle got me started on the whole 80's goth kick I'm still on. I was a huge fan of The Cure so Robert Smith would've been my biggest hero.

Growing up, who were your heroes outside of music?

I don't remember having any heroes that were real. Pee-Wee Herman was someone I looked up to.

What was the first album you remember buying?

If I remember correctly, it was a cassette single of The Safety Dance by Men Without Hats

Was there any defining moment in your life when you knew that you wanted to write, record and perform music?

It was while I was at art school. I realized music was way more interesting than art. Even easier in a way. I dropped out and moved to New Orleans in search of my soul.

Who is your biggest influence in how you approach what you do today?

I like to think that I've reach a point where I have found my own voice and I'm doing my own thing my own way. David Bowie was my biggest influence most of my adult life. I've always felt that Bowie was a catalyst for thousands of musicians. People try to emulate him and his songwriting approach, his eclecticism, his vocal technique, his look, his moves. They'd always come away with their own voice in the end. Anyways, he's dead now.

What is the proudest moment of your career so far?

Probably my short-lived collaboration with the artist Rita Ackermann. We recorded a few tracks last year that will find their way onto my next EP.

What is your favourite Book?

Phillip K. Dick - The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch

What is your favourite Album?

Iggy Pop - The Idiot

What is your favourite Film?

Withnail & I

What is your favourite TV Show?

The original Twilight Zone

Do you have a favourite film/tv/musical soundtrack?

Anything by John Carpenter.

Are there any new albums you are binge listening to at the moment?

I don't listen to much new stuff. It's all rehashed old stuff anymore. Sometimes done very well but unoriginal all the same. That goes for my music too as far as I'm concerned. Alien Sex Fiend has been on heavy rotation 'round here lately.

You're walking somewhere and your mp3 player has only a little battery left; You’'e only got time for one more song. What song do you play?

Howard Jones - "What is Love?"

What advice would you give to your younger self?

Don't spend so much time worrying about everything. It always works out. Also, be more confident. Chin-up, buddy.

If you could ask any person – living or passed – any question, who would it be and what would you ask them?

I'd ask someone passed about what happens when we die.

Do you have any upcoming projects you'd like to mention?

I'd like to get another EP out early next year.

Could you tell us a joke?

Dyslexic man walks into a bra.

## Thanks

A big thank you to Bad Electric for taking the time to answer those questions. I really can not wait to hear his next E.P. that he mentions above, so you should go and [buy his current one now](https://badelectric.bandcamp.com/releases) on bandcamp, and help make it happen.
