The LUX E.P. by Bad Electric was my first taste of their music with the opening song, "TON\_UP", grabbing my interest immediately. It has a super catchy and deep synth bass line that I just couldn't help but love. The vocals too are fantastic. The guy's voice is very reminiscent of Edwyn Collins mixed with a little bit of Lou Reed and David Bowie.

The next two songs, "MON\_NO\_AWARE" and "COLLISON" continue the synth sauciness. The former being an instrumental, and the latter having a vocal sound closer to Bowie than the opening.

I love how with some of his songs' endings, he adds in a surprise little twist too. The fresh synth sound at the end of the hypnotic "MONO\_NO\_AWARE"; The acoustic guitar that finishes "TON\_UP".

The biggest curve ball however is the E.P.'s closing song, "A\_QUARTER\_AFTER\_MIDNIGHT". This one is a pretty powerful acoustic song after an otherwise mostly synth collection.

This is definitely an artist I'll be keeping on my radar. If he can make an E.P. as full and great as this, then a full-length album would be off the charts.

You really should [buy theÂ LUX e.p. now from Bandcamp](https://badelectric.bandcamp.com/).
