I keep seeing negative reviews of the Suicide Squad, but you know what? I had fun, dammit. Suicide Squad was a lot of fun - there, I said it.

Don't go into this film expecting much more than it is - an action-packed, romping, stomping arcade of cinema fun. Because that is what it is. I did however end up caring for most of the characters. I mean, the witch was pushing it a bit, her gyrating to a huge smoke of destruction of some machine or another was a slight downer, but I accepted it as the catalyst for a fun ride.

In regards to the world of the Suicide Squad, I went into the film having no prior knowledge to most of the characters. I knew Harley Quinn's background with the Joker but that was about it. So I didn't have that comic book baggage that I've seen people complaining about - about how Harley Quinn and The Joker's abusive relationship has been down-played.

## There's a bit of ass going on

If you're going to be offended by a lady bending over in hot pants then don't watch this film. I'm not going to pretend the film's not flaunting Harley Quinn's ass quite a bit, it is. However it was good to see her character coming across as more than just a wiggling bum. She had a vulnerability that she masked with the fact that she is just plain mental. Plus I've been a fan of Margot Robbie since she played the not-quite-as-mental Donna Friedman in Neighbours.

Jared Leto was a surprise Joker for me. I actually really liked him as the Clown Prince of Darkness. His portrayal was fresh, as Heath Ledger's was before him. Not only that but he gave a decent edge of darkness to the character. His darkness came out when dealing with the relationship between him and Harley Quinn. Their relationship is destructive and somehow beautiful at times.

My favourite scene with them was probably The Joker holding Harley Quinn up in a vat of chemicals, during an origin scene, with paint twisting around them.

## Pacing and Climax

I found myself interested all the way through the film. There was never a point at which I got bored. There were moments of annoyance as characters made stupid decisions, but I'm finding myself being less critical of a film's short-comings nowadays. I try to enjoy the ride instead of moaning about one particular turn.

As climaxes go this film's was okay. I mean, I wasn't particularly bothered about the possibility of the end of the world, or the main baddies themselves, but I _was_ bothered about the main characters. I wanted Deadshot to get home to his daughter; for Diablo to find his peace; and of course for Harley Quinn to find her Puddin'.
