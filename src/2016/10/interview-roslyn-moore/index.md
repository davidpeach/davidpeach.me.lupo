This week I am excited to share an interview I did with one of my favourite lady performers at the moment - [Roslyn Moore](http://www.roslynmoore.com/). You should be listening to her music, specifically her awesome album, "[Hazy (A Desert Opera)](https://soundcloud.com/roslyn-moore/sets/hazy-a-desert-opera)". [I wrote a review of the album](/2016/09/27/hazy-a-desert-opera-by-roslyn-moore/) recently and can't recommend it enough.

Roslyn is part of a genre of music known as "Sadcore" and works often with another favourite of mine, "[Scarlett Taylor](http://www.scarletttaylor.com/)" who [I interviewed last month](/2016/09/09/interview-scarlett-taylor/).

Without further ado let's chat with Roslyn Moore.

## The Interview

Please tell us about yourself in as many or as little words as you like.

I'm a bit out there. The more people I come in contact with, the more I realise how differently I seem to view the world than the average person.

Growing up, who were your heroes in music?

I don't have a specific name to give. Everyone in music was inspiring to me. I always admired anyone who was able to express themselves openly through music. It's not an easy thing to put yourself out there and be exposed in that way.

Growing up, who were your heroes outside of music?

Because I always felt so unsure of myself, I really admired people who were just the opposite. People who are unapologetically themselves. So many people live their lives based on what other people perceive of them.

Was there any defining moment in your life when you knew that you wanted to write, record and perform music?

I can't say there was one defining moment. I've always been drawn towards music and wanting to make music, but I was always kind of shy about singing and putting myself out there. I never felt I was good enough. As time went on I just stopped caring as much about how I may come across to other people, and started living for myself. I never really had much of a desire to actually get out there and perform, but now that I've been able to create music I feel connected with, I'm much more excited to get out there and bring it to life!

Where do you get your creative energy from?

I draw a lot from my personal experiences and how I view the world. I also get a lot of inspiration from films I like.

What is the proudest moment of your career so far?

Performing at the Whiskey a Go-Go in Hollywood, CA and seeing my name on Hollywood Blvd. It was so cool.

What is your favourite Book?

Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn

What is your favourite Album?

This is such a hard one to answer! I can't say I have one overall all time favorite album, but rather I go through different phases where I will binge listen to one album and it will be my favorite for that period of time and then I'll move on from it.

What is your favourite Film?

Another hard one to answer! I love film nearly as much (if not as much) as I do music! So it's hard to pick one favorite, but I really love Quentin Tarantino's films. I'd say in general his are my favorite. But I have many favorites!

What is your favourite TV Show?

I don't want a lot of TV and when I do it's usually just on Netflix. I'll watch as much as I can of one show and then move on to the next. I just finished Breaking Bad and I'm now finishing up Narcos. Really love both!

Do you have a favourite film/tv/musical soundtrack?

I can't say I have a favorite soundtrack, but I do really love and enjoy music in film and television. It has such a large effect on the overall feel of the moment and adds so so much. I can't wait to have my music accompany film or tv like that.

Are there any new albums you are binge listening to at the moment?

Lately I've been binging on Skeleton Tree by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. I'm loving it. It was the perfect soundtrack to my recent trip to California.

You’re walking somewhere and your mp3 player has only a little battery left; You’ve only got time for one more song. What song do you play?

Asking all the hard questions! It would probably depend on the day, but off the top of my head I would pick Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd

What advice would you give to your younger self?

You are good enough to follow your dreams. Don't put them off.

## A Big Thank you

Thank you so much to Roslyn for taking the time to answer those questions. I always love to learn more about the person behind the music and Roslyn did not disappoint. At the time I contacted her she was actually mid-way into her tour, so I appreciate her fitting this interview into her schedule.

Take a listen to [Roslyn's music over on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/roslyn-moore) right this instant. That's an order.
