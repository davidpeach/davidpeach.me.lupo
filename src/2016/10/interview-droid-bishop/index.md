[Droid Bishop](https://droidbishop.bandcamp.com/) is a well known and respected name within the synthwave scene. [He has music on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/droidbishop) that spans back several years, which you should definitely go and check out.

This month I was lucky enough to be able to send him some questions to answer and with Bishop-like precision, he got the answers straight back to me.

## The Interview

Please tell us about yourself in as many or as little words as you like.

I am Droid Bishop. I live & make music in Los Angeles. This city at night is the best place and time to exist.

Growing up, who were your heroes in music?

My childhood musical heroes (who are still my heroes) include, Michael Jackson, Metallica, Queen, The Misfits, Daft Punk, Steely Dan, Pink Floyd, Django Reinhardt, Tupac, and many many more.

Growing up, who were your heroes outside of music?

Arnold Swarzenegger, Bruce Lee, Jamie Thomas, Harrison Ford, Marty McFly, Ferris Bueller , Zack Morris

What was the first album you remember buying?

Michael Jackson "Dangerous" on cassette

Was there any defining moment in your life when you knew that you wanted to write, record and perform music?

I've been playing music since I was 7 years old, but after discovering Metallica's early albums I knew that was it for me.

Who is your biggest influence in how you approach what you do today?

Daft Punk, Tycho, Todd Terje, Power Glove, Com Truise, Aphex Twin

What is the proudest moment of your career so far?

Receiving messages from fan's letting me know that my music makes their life better. That is what music/art should be about.

What is your favourite Book?

The Alchemist

What is your favourite Album?

I don't know if I can answer that, but a few top choices would be: Michael Jackson "Thriller" , Metallica "Master of Puppets" , Daft Punk "Discovery", Steely Dan "The Royal Scam"

What is your favourite Film?

Die Hard

What is your favourite TV Show?

Seinfeld

Do you have a favourite film/tv/musical soundtrack?

At the moment, "It Follows" film score. Also, "Back To The Future"

Are there any new albums you are binge listening to at the moment?

Not at the moment. I'm working on new music, so I tend to block everything else out while I'm in that process.

You’re walking somewhere and your mp3 player has only a little battery left; You’ve only got time for one more song. What song do you play?

Probably an unreleased demo of Droid Bishop song that i'm working on.

What advice would you give to your younger self?

Take it easy on the drugs & alcohol.

If you could ask any person – living or passed – any question, who would it be and what would you ask them?

I would ask Freddie Mercury if we could make a song together.

Your stage name must be a reference to Bishop from Aliens. What made you use him for your name?

I had made a song many many years ago, titled " Android Bishop" after the character from Aliens. I love that movie and so I just dropped the "A" for Droid and thought it would fit with my Sci Fi synth wave style.

Could you tell us a joke?

Knock Knock.  
Who's there?  
...Go fuck ya self
