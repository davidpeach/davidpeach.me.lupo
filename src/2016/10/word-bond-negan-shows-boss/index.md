Like many of the other comments on The Walking Dead's seventh season opening episode, I too found it the most shocking. For me this episode showcased one of the best things that the writers do - take what you think you know and turn it around.

The drawing out of the big reveal set out by last season's finale was left just the right length for me. Not only did it keep me on the edge of my seat, anxious, it also succeeded in putting me into as close to Rick's frame of mind as it could. I don't think I've ever been as anxious and upset and angry during one episode ever before. Of _any_ TV show. The base of my spine was aching by the end from being that anxious while watching.

I've seen people writing about how the show was "too much" or that it had "jumped the shark". What a load of bull. Negan is an evil bastard and will do anything to ensure his followers do exactly what he commands. He takes no shit and leads by example. The world of the Walking Dead has always been a brutal one and I think some people have become too comfortable in Rick leading the way and being the big boss man. I'm so glad a character like Negan has come into it to truly push our heroes to their emotional and physical limits.
