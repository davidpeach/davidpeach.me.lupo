About a month ago I shared an awesome song by LOCK called "Click". I have been listening to this song quite a lot and had become a big LOCK fan based on it. So when I heard about their new E.P. "[Everlasting Road](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/everlasting-road-single/id1146890888)", I was well up for it.

The title song opens with a seductive, twangy, reverbed electric guitar. The vocals are just as seductive and leads into the explosive wall of sound that is the chorus. I can't tell you how much this song rocks. The second song on this two-track E.P. is just as great, but with a slower tempo and calmer delivery.

Because I'd listened to "Click" over and over again, I kind of expected a similar sound with their E.P. When I heard it, I was taken back, and it has only got me more excited about their debut album. Each of their initial releases have had such an interesting diversity, and have been so expertly done, that for me it only points to a great debut album to come.

You can buy [Everlasting Road](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/everlasting-road-single/id1146890888) on iTunes now.
