When I first heard about this happening I was sceptical at how good it would be. I love country music, what I’ve heard of it anyway, and I love Kiefer Sutherland as an actor. But when I heard of him releasing a country song, I was sceptical to say the least.

I knew I’d end up liking it, but initially thought I would simply because it was Kiefer. But do you know what? I genuinely love this song and am really looking forward to his album this summer. It feels to me like genuine country music, full of that brand of melancholy we know and love of the genre.

Well done Kiefer!
