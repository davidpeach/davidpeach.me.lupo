Hana Pestle, stage name HANA, is from the same musical camp as artists like Grimes, in that she writes, records, produces and performs all her own music. This makes her music undeniably her own, with its own distinct sound.

[Her E.P](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/hana-ep/id1084326251)., eponymously-titled, stands as a testament to her abilities as a complete recording artist and a bloody good one.

The songs on this E.P. are ethereal in sound and feeling, but her powerful, commanding voice gives the songs some real weight. There are lots of cool audio sample effects and loops throughout the twenty two minutes of the HANA e.p. too. I don't think she'd had much production experience under her belt when making this E.P. but her experimentation and persistence really paid off to give us one of the best E.P.s of the year.

> Like my father and my mother  
> I will love you for forever  
> Hold my hand and dive now sister  
> Breathe with me underwater

> Underwater by HANA

HANA is someone that truly has that "special something" that you can't quite put your finger on. I mean, yes she knows the ins and outs of her craft; and yes, she has a tremendous vocal and songwriting talent, but there's also something that is greater than the sum of the parts.

As an aside, if you ever get a chance to see her perform live you should. I saw her earlier this year both supporting Grimes as well as performing in her band with her. From that performance alone, it's obvious that she isn't just a performer of this great music - she is it's creator and its master. She weaves the music to her will for a truly captivating show that you just have to experience.

For me, HANA is on the same footing as artists like [Lorde](/2017/07/04/melodrama-lorde/), [Lana Del Rey](/2015/12/07/honeymoon-by-lana-del-rey/) and [Tove Lo](/2016/11/07/lady-wood-by-tove-lo/). It's no surprise that [many of her contemporaries too are big fans](http://www.mtv.com/news/2159175/hana-lorde-lana-del-rey-clay-grimes/). Take one listen and you will be too.
