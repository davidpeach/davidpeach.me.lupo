Droid Bishop, in reference to Lance Henriksen’s character from Aliens, is a well-known name within the Synthwave scene. Today I am sharing one of the first songs I heard of his, “Color and Data”.

Also I have [an interview I did with Droid Bishop](https://davidpeach.me/2016/10/18/interview-droid-bishop/).
