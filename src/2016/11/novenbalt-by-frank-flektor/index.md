At the time of writing I have only been able to find two songs by Frank Flektor – “Novenbalt” and “Robotic”. “Novenbalt” is the one I chose to share today in my 33 days of Synthwave. This song jumped out of the blue at me and felt very reminiscent of Tron.

I’m looking forward to all future releases by Frank Flektor. If they are as good as this one, we’re in for a treat.
