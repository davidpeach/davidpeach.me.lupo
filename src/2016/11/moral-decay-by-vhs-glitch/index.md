Today’s song isn’t a song as such, but rather an album sample. I’ve only heard the sample so far but I will be buying all of VHS Glitch’s stuff. Every part of it is golden and is filled with that warm 80s goodness.

You can buy the album from [bandcamp](https://vhsglitch.bandcamp.com/album/moral-decay-album).
