Katie Ellie is an artist I discovered by accident whilst searching Soundcloud, and I'm glad I did.

Despite her career still being in its early stages, she has already had airtime on BBC radio, as well as being nominated by the Hollywood Music Awards for the Best Alternative song for 2015, with her original song "[Miss Lionheart](https://soundcloud.com/katie_elliex/miss-lionheart)".

I had the pleasure of interviewing the Bradford-based artist, which you can read below.

Please tell us about yourself in as many or as little words as you like

Hey! So, I'm Katie Ellie (Well my name is actually Katie Holdsworth but I got the "Ellie" from my middle name which is Elizabeth haha! I'm from West Yorkshire! Most would say I'm blonde inside and out although I do carry a wise head on my shoulders. I've recently turned 25 years old, cringe! I do only look around 18 though so that's a bonus. I used to play the piano when I was younger but my parents left it at one of our old homes and I did buy a guitar but I just don't have the patience for it so I stick to writing and singing instead.

Growing up, who were your heroes in music?

I've always been really open minded when it comes to music, I was obsessed with Steps, like I'd buy all of their CDs, DVDs, practise dance routines and go to their gigs when I was little. I made my own little steps band on the street and pretended to be Claire. Sad I know haha! \*blush\* I listened to Eminem a lot too, loved The Smiths, James Morrison, then fell in love with Delta Goodrems music. it was so beautiful and different.

Growing up, who were your heroes outside of music?

I think I felt an instant connection with anyone who had a passion for something. I just looked up to anyone who did the things they loved.

What was the first album you remember buying?

It was definitely Steps. I just loved their enthusiasm and they were just so likeable.

Was there any defining moment in your life when you knew that you wanted to write, record and perform music?

Well, since nursery & throughout middle school I would always be amazed by music and then when I was 8 I'd sit and record the radio every Sunday afternoon from 5pm - 7pm onto my cassette tape, then rewind it and write down all the lyrics to my favourite songs so I could sing along and I'd grab an empty milkshake bottle and use it as a microphone. After that I started writing my own songs and would hum my own melodies.

Who is your biggest influence in how you approach what you do today?

I'm still at the very beginning. I'm learning and growing every day independently. I've always paid attention to detail so It's easier to observe other people. I love artists who are very realistic And connect with their fans and stay true to themselves so I take all their good traits and interpret that into my own life. I've made mistakes but all the struggles makes everything worth the while.

What is the proudest moment of your career so far?

The first song I ever took to the studio to record called "Miss Lionheart" was nominated by the Hollywood Music and Media awards for the best alternative song of 2015, so that was an incredible achievement and made me want to push myself out even further.

What is your favourite Book?

I used to have a lot of poetry books when I was younger so I love them. I never really read novels because I'd always been more visual.

What is your favourite Album?

I love The Script #3 I find it so comforting and very inspirational. There are a lot of uplifting and motivational songs in it.

What is your favourite Film?

Oh my gosh a film called "Listen to your heart" it's such a beautiful film. A deaf girl and a guy meet. He plays piano and writes his own music but really likes her so learns some sign language and they fall in love. Her mum tries to break them up and does everything he can to separate them. The guy ends up getting cancer and becomes very very ill. The girl goes against her mums wishes and decides she wants an operation to finally hear for the first time because the guy desperately wants her to hear the world and the beauty.. (Agh I don't want to give the end away.. Don't read further if you want to watch this) so yeah, the guy and girl finally meet again. She goes into hospital to have her operation and the guy is rushed in and ends up on his death bed. The girl gets out finally able to hear and the guy has sadly passed away but leaves her a CD with a song on it that he wrote for her for when she got out of hospital. I cried! So much.. It's beautiful! It makes me feel so lucky to be able to hear the world and the little things in life like birds, traffic etc.

What is your favourite TV Show?

I love the impractical jokers U.S! They're such funny guys. I love that they just have no boundaries it's hilarious.

Do you have a favourite film/tv/musical soundtrack?

Oh my gosh I think the one that absolutely tugged on my heart strings is the Fast and Furious 7 soundtrack, Charlie Pugh - See you again. Just the lyrics and way it is sung is incredible. Moves me.

Are there any new albums you are binge listening to at the moment?

My ultimate favourite band are The Dunwells. Their music is awesome. I love the indie sounds and feel. The harmonies are incredible and it's just a breath of fresh air! So excited for their next album "Light up the sky" to be released.

You're walking somewhere and your mp3 player has only a little battery left; You've only got time for one more song. What song do you play?

I would have to play Birdy - Wild Horses. That song takes me into a complete new world. I get totally lost in my thoughts for so long after hearing it.

What advice would you give to your younger self?

I would tell myself never ever to worry what other people think and just take every opportunity and do what I love without being worried about rejection and failure. I spent far too many years not feeling good enough.

If you could ask any person - living or passed - any question, who would it be and what would you ask them?

That is such a great question. I'd probably ask Birdy how she comes up with such beautiful and unique lyrics.

Could you tell us a joke?

What do you call cheese that’s not yours? It’s nacho cheese So old, I know! Awkward!!! :)
