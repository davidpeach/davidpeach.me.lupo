I think I may be addicted to playing Bitcoin Billionaire. It's annoying because I know it's a waste of time and yet I still find myself tapping away like a mad person.

Discovered a new album through some random listens today -- Sex Dreams and Denim Jeans by Uffie. From the first song on this album I was hooked.

Tinkered with my site again tonight. I think I'm gonna add in a playlists post type too.

Think I'm gonna now have an hour or so on The Last Of Us: Left Behind. So far I'm loving it.
