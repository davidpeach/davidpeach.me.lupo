Playing through The Last of Us again. I think that this is the first game since final fantasy 7 where I've started it again as soon as I completed it. This time I felt more bad ass because I know the enemy patterns and what to expect when.

Listened to Foxes' new album today. Is pretty good on first and second listen, which reminds me I still need to write up my favourite albums of 2015.

Tickets have been booked for me, Aaron and Dwayne to go see Chas and Dave in April.
