At first I thought that this would be a bit of a gimmick, but it has legit grown on me and is now in my regular playlist.

I am addicted to running around the world of Raccoon City in Resident Evil 2 and the recently-released Resident Evil 3 Remake.

I'm looking forward to any music that the same creator can bring from RE3's world in the coming weeks / months.
