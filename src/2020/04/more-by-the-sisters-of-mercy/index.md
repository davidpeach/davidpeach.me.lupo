> Lyrics by Jim Steinman

My first time hearing this song was in fact as a cover by Meat Loaf on his album [Braver Than We Are](https://davidpeach.co.uk/2017/11/17/braver-than-we-are-by-meat-loaf/). The song was actually written by Jim Steinman whose most well-known collaborator is Meat Loaf. And he has been known to reuse his songs for different artists over the years
