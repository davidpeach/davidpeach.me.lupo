I saw the video for a new Ozzy Osbourne song the other day and it didn't really float my boat. However, once I actually listened to the song through a decent pair of headphones, as opposed to my terrible computer speakers, the song really jumped out at me.

As an aside the album I can take it or leave it, but I have much respect for Ozzy still putting himself out there and doing what he does.

Despite my not fully digging the album, it is always a pleasure to hear his idiosyncratic voice backed by riffing guitar.
