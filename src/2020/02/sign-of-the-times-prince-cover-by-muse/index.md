Possibly one of my favourite covers of any song I've heard. This is how covers should be done.

I remember hearing this for the first time in my first web development job. I was working for a small local company, whose office was the upstairs level of a converted barn.

Usually the radio -- permanently fixed on Radio One -- soon became tiresome for me as the same songs seemed to be played at the same time every damn day.

But one magical day I happened to hear the Live Lounge wear I heard Matt Belamy's signature guitar sound riffing to a tune I recognised but could not name.

When I finally worked it out it hit me like a freight train.

This song is fucking incredible.
