Today is the day when I finally started to learn a new programming language -- one that I have never touched before. I had briefly touched on and considered Go. However, I have settled on [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

It is the first compiled language that I have started to learn and am looking forward to the challenges it will bring.

I will also be doing my best to blog about things I learn -- much of it probably in more of a brain-dump format -- to both help others as well as reinforcing my own learning.
