Something in this song feels haunting to me. I can't quite place my finger on it. It could be the way that each of their voices meets in that ethereal plane that few bands have managed to reach - a sound that I associate with the golden age of music, at least in my opinion.

I remember watching part of a film in college film studies called "[Chungking Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chungking_Express)", which featured this song prominently. I never really paid attention to that film, but I can't help but feel I should go back and watch it now I'm older and... wiser?
