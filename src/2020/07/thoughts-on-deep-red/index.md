About ten years ago I bought three bootleg Giallo films from a seller at my local memorabilia fair. Fast forward to now and I'm further exploring this glorious world of artistic violence.

One of the most well-known Directors of this genre is a man called Dario Argento. Argento is responsible for films like Suspiria, Cat O' Nine Tails and The Bird with the Crystal Plumage.

But the film of his I wanted to get my thoughts down about today was Deep Red.

## What is Deep Red about?

After witnessing a violent, blood-splattered murder from the streets below, Pianist -- turned amateur sleuth -- Marcus Daly takes it upon himself to investigate the killing. He is sure that there was something strange about the crime scene when he first arrived. Something that he just can't place.

His curiosity leads him on the trail of an old urban legend. But as his investigation continues, so too do the grizzly killings. And I have to say -- each and every murder in Deep Red is as hypnotic as it is violent.

The film holds it's cards pretty close to its chest right up until the end. However, if you are diligent enough, you may just find a clue during the film that could help you solve it before Marcus does.

I think first and foremost this is a mystery thriller, but the horror is so well crafted that I can't help but think of it as a horror film too.

to be finished...
