For the past ten days I have been doing the 100 day challenge.

I decided to have a go at building my own e-commerce CMS.

I don't have a big passion for e-commerce. In fact most of the time I work with e-commerce it frustrates me. But then I always remember hearing the old saying:

"The best way of complaining about something is to try and build something better".

I won't say which e-commerce CMS has me often cursing. Those who know me will know by the curses and moaning directed at it.

It feels good to be 10 days in. It's also the longest commit streak ever on my github account.

I think the biggest thing I am taking away from my 100 day project is the learning I'm doing along the way. The outcome is kind of irrelevant at this point in time -- although it would be nice to have something to show for it at the end.
