I've been in training for a half-marathon on the 18th October and two weeks ago I injured my knee. Well, I say injured, it started aching badly the day after and so I had to take a week off.

After said week, I went out again and half way through that run it started to twinge again. So I walked back.

Another week or so has passed and I have been on a six-mile run earlier this evening. So far no pains and really hope not to have any tomorrow.

If I have to walk this half-marathon I'm going to do it. My aim is to do the 13.1 miles in two hours or less.
