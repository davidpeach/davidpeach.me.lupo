These are the steps I took in setting up Linux Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS on my spare computer.

1. Download [Ubuntu Server](http://web.archive.org/web/20160415064323/http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server) from the official site

3. Make a bootable USB stick following [this guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20160415064323/http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu)

5. Insert new bootable USB into what will be your server, then turn it on

7. Follow the installation instructions

Installation

Firstly you'll need to select a language. I picked English - my native tongue.

The next step will give you a number of options:

- Install Ubuntu Server

- Multiple server install with MAAS

- Check disk for defects

- Test Memory

- Boot from first hard disk

- Rescue a broken system

I first selected 'Check disc for defects'. Once that had run it restarted the install process. I then selected 'Test Memory' and let it do its thing. I'm not quite sure what I was looking for with these first couple of tests. I'm no system administrator, so anything short of a red flashing light would look fine to me.
