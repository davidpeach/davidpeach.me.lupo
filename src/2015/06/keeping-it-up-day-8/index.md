Today is the first day of an exciting week - London for two days followed by Paris for 6 days. I don't think its hit me yet that I'm going on holiday, but I'm sure it will once we land.I'm looking forward to walking the streets of Paris in the hot sunshine with my good lady and getting lost down some side streets. Last time I went to Paris I went alone, for a concert, so it will be nice this time to share the time.Before all that is London Zoo and Carmen at the ENO. Never been to either so that'll be an experience.
