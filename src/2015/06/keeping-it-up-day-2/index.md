I bought a new cage for Moomin on Friday night. I loved the idea of him having a higher one so he could climb up further. The idea of the high platforms seemed cool too. However in practice it wasn't suitable at all - he kept falling off the platform and knocking the loosley-coupled platform bridges out.So I've opted to go for the same one as he had before. Pets at home were very helpful in getting it exchanged as well as letting me have some spare parts.I'm even thinking about connecting the two cages together - as they are the same model - to make Moomin a sort of super-lair. I'll let you know how that one pans out.
