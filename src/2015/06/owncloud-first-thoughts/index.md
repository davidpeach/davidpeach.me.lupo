I have just installed ownCloud on my laptop as a testing ground.

I am soon to be buying a new computer off a friend and will be using my current one as a personal server.

I decided to go with owncloud because it seems to do everything I need it to right out of the box. Cross device file syncing with as much storage as I have on my computer.

All I had to do was install owncloud via the ubuntu terminal following these steps.

I am starting using it on version 8.1 and first impressions are that it is very nice.

It has a clean UI and straight forward settings controls.

This is going to be a big step in me taking control of my own data and moving away from services like Google and Dropbox.

The big job now will be to import all of my photos out of Google as well as re-downloading all of my music from google play music.
