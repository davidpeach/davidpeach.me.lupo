The Tale of Peter Rabbit was an enjoyable little read. One thing that did stand out to me was the fact that out of the four rabbit siblings, the three girls were the well-behaved ones and Peter, the only boy, was the naughty little one who snuck on to Mr McGregor's land. Was Beatrix Potter biased or am I reading too much into it? Nonetheless an enjoyable read.
