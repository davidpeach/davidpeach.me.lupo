I've not been keeping it up, have I?(phrasing)Try and try again I shall.Tonight I saw the first episode of humans - very good it was. It's interesting to see exactly what it means to be 'human' - to haveÂ consciousness. The acting was great - I even tried making a cup of tea like a robot afterwards and it's actually harder than it seems. It will be interesting to see where the show goes - especially as dark elements have already begun to creep in.Later on I ended up listening to an old episode of Cabin Pressure - Qikiqtarjuaq. It's been about a year since I first heard this series and had forgotten how good it is. Benedict Cumberbatch is probably best known for playing Sherlock in the BBC series, but one should also check him out in Cabin Pressure. He, along with the rest of the cast, have incredible chemistry in one of the funniest series I've ever heard.
