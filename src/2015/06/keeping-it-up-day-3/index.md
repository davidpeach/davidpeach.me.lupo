So I have failed completely so far in writing an entry each day. I have some poor excuses if that's any consolation? I broke my computer and spent ages trying to reinstall it; I've also got a sore throat and cough……yep I know, I know pretty pathetic.So two months ago I signed up for the London marathon 2016. During my training I pushed myself a bit too hard and strained my ankle. I've not been able to train for nearly three weeks. But since buying an ankle support, it seems to be getting better. So this Sunday I'll head out for a jog and see how it feels.I've not been confirmed for the London Marathon - the winners are announced in September/October time.However I will hopefully be doing a couple of half marathons before the end of the year. So that should help me gauge my fitness level.
