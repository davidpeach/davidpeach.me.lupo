Today's been a naff day. I've felt pretty aweful with this sore throat and cough. Please - send me no flowers.I'm looking forward to later tonight when I'll get to watch the Game of Thrones series finale for the second time - I'm more looking forward to how my girlfriend reacts to the outcome of certain characters. I have the responsibility of warning her just before any gruesome bits happen - the temptation not to torments me, but I will do my duty.Tomorrow we are taking her mom to Dudley Zoo, which should be nice - hopefully I can kick some of this cough before then. Looking forward to getting some good snappy snaps of the animals. Here's hoping we have some nice weather.
