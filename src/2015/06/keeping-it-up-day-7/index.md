Another day of feeling like crap today.Didn't really get anything done, which annoys me. I just watched a bunch of interviews with Clive Barker, which led me to finally read his short story, _Jacqueline Ess: Her last will and testiment. A really great story - part of the Books of Blood volume 2.I then went on to watch a couple of interviews with Steve Jobs. I've never been a fan of Apple products, except for the iPod, but he was an inspiring guy._As I did a quick search for Jacqueline Ess to make sure I'd spelt it right, I found out that Lena Headey will be playing the titular character in a film that is currently in the works.
