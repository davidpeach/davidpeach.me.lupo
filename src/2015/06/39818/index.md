I really hope that Jurassic World is good. I really want it to be good. The first time I'd watched the trailer it didn't really do much for me. I remember thinking "Oh look - a super-dinosaur, and look it's managed to escape its ill-equipped cage". But nonetheless I am going to go with an open mind.
