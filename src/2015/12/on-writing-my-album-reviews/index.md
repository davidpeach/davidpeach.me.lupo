Three weeks ago I launched a new website side-project.

This was a purely creative outlet for me, doing something I've wanted to do for a while -- write album reviews.

Well, they're not specifically reviews; more like recommendations. When I hear albums I want to share with people, I now try to write a little piece about it.

At the time of writing this, I have not long finished the third album -- Priest's eponymous debut. But I am already starting to worry that I'll run out of ways to describe these albums.

I know that they are all different and I know the thoughts I want to get across to readers, but I'm just worried that I wont do these artists I love listening to justice.

I'm going to continue this in the same vein as the 100 days project, except I'm going to publish one every week on a Tuesday evening. I just know that if I tried to do one a day the writing would be even worse and I'd probably fall behind and end up not actually doing any.

So a realistic goal like once a week should be manageable. You can see the reviews I've got scheduled on the coming soon page. Cheers, Dave.
