Facebook, Twitter, Google plus - all places that help you to publish easily - and for free - on the web.

But guess what, the web is already free - or at least it should be - and many people's only notion of publishing on the web is through one of these, or other, third party silos. **It doesn't have to be this way**.

And it _shouldn't_ be this way.

## Where are we now?

In the beginning there was the web. This completely revolutionised publishing and gave everyone a chance to have their voice heard. 25 years on and that is still the case. Only now we have these monolithic silos that have made publishing even easier, and for free (zero cost).

The problem with free though, is that it comes at a price. All of these companies that offer you the opportunity to publish and get your thoughts out there, are doing so to serve their real customers - their partners and investors. You see, every piece of information you pass into these silos, whether knowingly or not, is used to help profile you and your friends. **This profiling and tracking goes on to help make you more susceptible to targetted advertising** - the core business model of most modern-day tech "startups".

Imagine a world where everyone's thoughts and opinions are only published through one of the current "Ministries of Truth", where the publisher only shows what it wants to show; hiding what it wants to hide as it "currates your timeline".

We desperately need many more independent avenues of information and points of view from people, not corporations, if we are ever going to get a chance at a more free on open world online.

## The Indieweb

The [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/) is an initiative; a community, with the aim of publishing on ones own website and taking back control over the content that they publish.

Everyone who has access to the web has the potential - and it's not as hard as it may seem - to get started publishing with you in control. The Indieweb isn't about jumping through hoops to publish in a particular way either - **the whole point is to do it your way and under your terms**.

You should be able to publish and present your content in exactly the way that you want to. This post is about introducing you to the concept of the Indieweb - to the concept of your being in control of your own writing and publishing.

To get started on your path to online writing freedom, **head over to the** [**Indieweb**](https://indieweb.org/) **site now for advice**.
