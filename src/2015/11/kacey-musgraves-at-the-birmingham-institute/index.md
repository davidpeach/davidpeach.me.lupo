One of the best concerts I've been to.

Although the wait in the queue outside lasted about half an hour, we were soon inside the small-modest sized venue, heating up with the ever-growing crowd and singing along to Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be).

The opening band, Sugar & The High Lows, were pretty good. They soon got the crowd revved up and ready for Kacey and band for their opener: Pageant Material.

Kacey and her band were spot on - one of the tightest performances I've heard live. And her voice was just as perfect as it sounds on her albums. The songs weren't precisely the same as on the albums - and that's a good thing. The band's improvisations - and indeed the covers they did - were performed with style.

As a note to self I must rememeber to take plently of water and not wear my coat inside again - by the end of the night I was dripping. I look forward to seeing them again on the next tour.
