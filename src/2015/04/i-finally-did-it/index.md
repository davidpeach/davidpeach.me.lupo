**_Update: I'm now using WordPress again._**

Ever since I can remember having my own website, for the most part, I have used WordPress. I've loved using it and will always recommend it to clients as being the best way for them to publish online.

Of course, with me being a web developer I'm always wanting to tinker.

There isn't a day that goes by without me messing about with something on my site.

A concept that I learned about, about six months ago or so, was that of the indieweb. Now this isn't some new platform or anything like that. Rather, it's a set of principles -- a way to approach publishing on the web. In fact it's the oldest method of publishing on the web: publishing on your own website.

WordPress is great for publishing. But as my needs became more complex, and needing to make more fine grained choices when publishling different sorts of posts, I found myself neglecting to post notes/thoughts because the process of ticking the correct meta values and category was a bit combersome.

The process adding a quick note or thought, like that of jotting something in a notepad, should be quick and effortless. So what I wanted was a stripped-back UI from which to post notes, as well as other kinds of posts.

Because of this I decided to go with a framework as opposed to a CMS platform, choosing ultimately to go with Laravel. The process is still on going as I still need to configure 301 redirects from my old site. But at least I am now publishing from my new site, and new domain, and it's never been easier to do.
