My very first album write up goes to Tove Styrke's Kiddo. I had never heard of her before tonight - she was a recommendation by Google Play Music, based on my interest in 'Say Lou Lou'.

As soon as the first song started, I was hooked. Hooked enough to take advantage of my Android 6.0 update's new context awareness by demanding - "Google! Play me her first album"\* - that one is also great.

The first song sounded to be very Prince-esque - purple rain Prince - which can only be a good thing. Then there were other songs that had the sort of catchy hooks and beats you can't help but move your body to. I had been getting nowhere with what I was building tonight, which was annoying, but this album soon got me feeling on top of the world.

Stand out songs: Borderline, Even If I'm Loud It Doesn't Mean I'm Talking To You, Walking a Line.

\*I am since trying to rid my life of Google Inc. as much as I can.
