So I managed to complete the Birmingham half-marathon in 2 hours and 17 minutes. One of the things that has been imprinted on my memory is how the day seemed to bring out the best in all people.

People all along the 13.1 mile route were handing out sweets, water, and shouts of encouragement directed at specific people - whether they were friends or not. Countless times I had people cheering me on from my name on my runners number.It makes all the difference.

I especially found it great how even when running through areas of Birmingham that were less desirable - places where the people may normally be feared - had just the same encouragement and friendliness.
