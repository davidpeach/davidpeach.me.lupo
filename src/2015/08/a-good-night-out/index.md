Good night out with the CE team tonight at the usual haunt -- The Rose Villa Tavern.

It was the first time I've had food there. It was alright. I managed to drop all my chips on the floor but the waiter was cool to bring me a fresh batch.

I was advised by Hark to watch an Anime called Attack on Titan. From the trailer it looked pretty cool so I'll try and watch an episode or two this weekend.

On the train back I had yet another listen to my current album obsession, Say Lou Lou's 'Lucid Dreaming'.

Can't wait to hit the hay tonight -- absolutely shattered.

Also just remembered about the starting of the 100 days of CE this Tuesday. Of course it's up to each person when they want to start it. I just need to decide what it is that I'm doing.
