When I wrote [my previous Dead by Daylight article about the survival instinct](https://davidpeach.co.uk/2017/12/dead-by-daylight-the-survival-instinct/), I mentioned how playing survivor was my favourite. However, my preference has been slowly shifting towards playing the killer.

## What I love about playing the Killer

Playing as a survivor comes with it a certain degree of playing cautiously. Especially me still be a bit of a noob - I tend to get hooked whenever spotted. But playing as a killer, that's all gone. You're guaranteed to last till the end of the match and can choose whether to lurk in the shadows or run all over the map.  
I find it easier to get points as killer too. Running about and finding a survivor sneaking about is an easy 200 blood points; one hit on them and that's another 300. 
When I don't want to sneak about and focus too much, like first thing in the morning, the killer is a good wake-up play. That's not to say killers don't require focus, they do, I just enjoy running about and lucking upon those pesky kids.

## The Killer's objective

The clue really is in the name but the killer's objective is to kill - well, sacrifice, the survivors. You'll get 500 blood points for each hooking up of a survivor and so this is your main objective. It can be very tempting, indeed it was to me in my first games as killer, to stand facing a hooked survivor. This way you would catch or even put off anyone trying a would-be rescue attempt.  
But **this really is detrimental to you in maximising your own points** - and that's really what this game is about. Not to mention it just makes the game boring for all involved. So my advice would be to get off to the other broken generators once you've hooked someone. Unless you do see someone trying to be a hero - if they are foolish / unseasoned enough to show themselves near you, they really do deserve your attention.  
So always approach being the killer as you would a survivor, in that you should be looking to maximise your points always. There are times when 'camping' a hooked survivor can be a viable strategy, like when all generators are complete, but **use this option in good taste**. For your own good if not the survivors'.

## Beware of being baited

Early on in the starting ranks you will get a lot of survivors who are out for themselves. I've often had people waiting by the exit hatch alone as the last but one survivor dies on the hook. But later on you will get survivors who work very well as a team.  
What I've noticed is one of the survivors will often act as a bait for the killer. They will have the Killer chasing them through pallets, wasting valuable time, leading away from remaining broken generators. Don't be taken in by chasing a particular player when you could be delaying generator repairs.  
Your generators are your most important thing in the game - **protect them well**.

## Get to know your generators

One of the biggest tips I have gained recently, from [TydeTyme on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7pdAc6VEvI5ePDy-sBe7-Q), is in trying to control the game by the protection of certain generators.  
At the start of the game there will be seven broken generators needing repair to escape. When one more is needed for the Survivors', they will have three to choose from. The key I have found is to **do your best to control which three generators will be left at the end of the game**.  
What you need is three that are close by, allowing you an easy patrol path at the end of the game. And if those three happen to be near the basement, then happy days for you. And don't forget - you don't necessarily need to run right up to each one in turn. You can just run past them and listen for the generator's noise. Of course, having easy line-of-sight is handy too.  
Being in this position at the end of the game is extremely powerful for a Killer. Especially those ones that tend to come into their element towards the end of a game, such as 'The Shape'.

## Points to be gained

As with the survivors' game, playing killer is really about building up as many points as possible. I have found it's considered a win for the Killer if you sacrifice at least two. Remember that at the heart of this game **the Killer and the Survivors can work together**, in a manner of speaking, by opening up the opportunity for increasing each others points.  
So when a survivor drops a pallet on you, don't get mad - just destroy it for another 100 points. When you find them on a generator - give it some damage for a further 100 points. When you've hooked a survivor, leave them be and continue your search - allowing another one points for unhooking them; and you a potential further 500 points for re-hooking them later.  
Here are a few actions that will award you points as a killer:

- Finding and chasing a survivor

- Successfully hitting a survivor

- Hooking a survivor on a sacrificial hook

- Damaging a generator

- Destroying a dropped pallet

- Using your Killer's special ability. (Stalking as The Shape; Setting traps as The Hag or The Trapper etc.)

There are many more which can be found on the [Dead by Daylight wiki page](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bloodpoints#Bloodpoints_for_Killers), which is worth your time looking over.

## In Summary

Being a Killer is one of the most fun aspects of the game for me. Yes it can be very annoying when all four survivors are waiting in the exit gates for you, squatting repeatedly. But you know what? - you really can't win 'em all.  
Dead By Daylight is all about having fun together from both sides of the blade.
