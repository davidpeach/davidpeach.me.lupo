After about six months of owning the game, I have finally started playing Skyrim VR. And I've gotta say - it is so f\*\*king awesome. Okay so the graphics are still of the game's original era, but being in that world just feels so great nonetheless.

I get those butterflies in my stomach as I am freely exploring the wilderness.

I have only played the first few quests on the PC version of the game, and am glad I never pursued it back then. Because now I get experience what I have heard is a really great game for the first time all in VR.

Tonight I found I had saved the game in Riverun. I went and completely one of the only quests I was familiar with - the exploring ofÂ Bleak Falls Barrow and the finding of the Golden Claw.

Running through those caves, with each Playstation Move controller controlling a different hand for my magic spells, I felt pretty badass.

I'm looking forward to seeing where the adventure takes me.
