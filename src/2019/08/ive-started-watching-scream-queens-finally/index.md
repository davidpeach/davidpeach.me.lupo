I've been a fan of American Horror Story for a few years now - since Hotel first aired. So you'd think I'd have been all over Scream Queens too, given it was also created in part by both Brad Falchuk and Ryan Murphy.

But for some strange reason, known only to me I guess, I have only just decided to sit down and watch it.

And it is freakin' incredible!

The comic timing and sense of humour is on point in the pilot episode. So often it seemed I found myself being played like a fiddle at the whims of the creators. I found myself laughing out loud and then becoming appalled at myself for what I was laughing at.

All of the actors and actresses involved were fun to watch, but I have to give a special shout-out to original scream queen herself, Jamie Lee Curtis. I'm so happy she is in this show and can't wait to see what part she ultimately plays. And of course, one of my favourite American Horror Story alumni, Emma Roberts as the super-fucking-bitch Chanel.

Emma Roberts is so bloody disgusting in this show and yet I can't help but love her character. She is so much fun to watch just being an incredibly evil person to those around her. And something tells me that she won't get her just desserts any time soon.

I feel as though Scream Queens fell under the radar a bit, especially when compared to it's mature older cousin American Horror Story. But just from this opening pilot alone I have found it just as entertaining, if not even more so.

There were some great musical moments too - something I've just come to expect from these guys. And some awesome song choices too — especially the opening song by Bat For Lashes — 'What's A Girl To Do?'.

If I hadn't have had to get up early the next morning I'd probably have watched the next two or three episodes back to back. I guess I will have to wait.

Scream Queens is going to make a great show to keep my juices flowing ready for American Horror Story: 1984 in September.

I can't believe I've waited this long to actually get started on it.
