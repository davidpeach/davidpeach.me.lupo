Decided I'd finally give this gargantuan book a read.

One of the earliest films I remember seeing was the 2-part mini-series of Stephen King's IT. IT scared the undying crap out of me when I was about 6 or 7.

Now, many years later, I have decided to actually read the novel before part 2 of the new 2-part films is out.

HERE GOES...

...TIME TO FLOAT...

**_Edit_**: _After reading 50 pages, although enjoying it, I have decided to concentrate on_ [_The Dark Tower_](https://davidpeach.co.uk/tag/the-dark-tower/) _series for a while._
