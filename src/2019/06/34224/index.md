Rodney Trotter after going skateboarding with the Groovy Gang.

I just stumbled upon a classic episode of the TV series Only Fools And Horses -- "And the unlucky winner is...".

It's the one where Del Boy, Rodney and Cassandra win a holiday to Spain after Del sends one of Rodney's old school paintings into a cereal competition.

This series still stands up and I'm still laughing out loud watching it.

They truly don't make them quite like this anymore.
