Looking forward to getting back into Alien: Isolation on the PS4 tonight. I tried playing it about a year ago but I got about an hour or so into it and stopped playing. Dunno why I never went back to it.

However, I have been advised by a couple of mates through PSN that I need to give it another go. So I shall give it a good run this time.
