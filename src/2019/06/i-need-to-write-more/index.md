I literally started writing this post at the moment I had the thought that I should be writing more. I love the idea of being a writer and for that I know that all I need to do... is write.

You see, I keep finding myself wanted to write about different topics that interest me, however, I keep thinking that I need to put those posts within a "branded" website.

For example, I actively write on another blog at [](https://horror-manga.com)[https://horror-manga.com](https://horror-manga.com) which is about Horror Manga (in case you didn't guess). And that website is fine for me to write for too. But I found myself wanted to write about other aspects of horror. And instead of just writing on this website, I keep trying to come up with brandable website ideas in order to publish them somewhere I consider to be legit.

But this is actually keeping me from just writing about things that I want to write about.

That's why, as soon as I had this thought, I wanted to just write about it straight away. I want to stop trying to make myself some brandable entity and just fucking write because I enjoy it.

And aint even gonna edit this one... warts an' all.

Publish.
