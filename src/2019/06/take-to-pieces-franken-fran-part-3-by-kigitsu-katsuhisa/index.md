In Take to pieces, Fran is called upon by local Police Officers to help solve a mysterious crime spree. The Police are continuing to find huge amounts of dismembered body parts around town - hands, legs, feet. Too many to count. However, the real mystery is that all of these body parts belong to the same person - the DNA for each part are exact matches.

They soon pinpoint the origin of all of these body parts and Fran, being her normal wonderful self, throws herself in to help by way of extreme surgery. The surgery doesn't offer anything different to what we've seen previously. However, it does still manage to display Fran's unique set of skills.

There isn't really that much to the story by the way of twists and turns. But that doesn't mean it is any less enjoyable. While it doesn't have a big shock ended or a secret narrative going on beneath its top layer, it still manages to charm its reader. Or at least it charmed me.

## In Summary

Whilst it doesn't offer much new in Fran's world, Take to pieces is still an enjoyable read. I think that Fran has become one of those characters that I could probably watch in any kind of scenario. I could probably read a manga about her just sat watching T.V. or even just cooking her dinner.
