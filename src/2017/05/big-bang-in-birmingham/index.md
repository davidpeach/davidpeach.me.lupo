During the Second World War many bombs were dropped on the city of Birmingham.Â Known as the [Birmingham Blitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Blitz), this three year span did a great deal of damage to many buildings in and around the city. Not only that but thousands of people were either seriously injured or killed. According to the Wikipedia page around one fifth of the high explosive bombs failed to detonate.

Today in Aston, Birmingham [one of those unexploded bombs was detonated in a controlled explosion](http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/two-days-chaos-full-story-13044258), after being discovered more than twenty four hours previous.

Due to the location of the bomb, the main Birmingham expressway and the train line I use were closed off. Normally when news of cancelled trains hits me I immediately get annoyed with my working location - being from the other side of Birmingham. However, I couldn't help but be fascinated that a bomb from the World War 2 air raids had lay dormant all this time, waiting to be discovered.

Although this could have been potentially very disastrous for many people, it's still an interesting piece of history to be uncovered.

How many more undiscovered bombs remain to be found?
