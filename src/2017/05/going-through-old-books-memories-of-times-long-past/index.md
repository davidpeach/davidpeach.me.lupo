Yesterday I finally got round to sorting through a load of old books of mine that I have collected over the years. To anyone watching from the outside these will just look like a mess of old books on varying subjects - Clive Barker novels; Derren Brown-recommended psychology books; Music Theory and scale books. To me, these represent certain pockets of my life so far; different interests that have grabbed me and become an obsession at one time or another.

Sorting through these books is the first time in a long time that I have reminisced about times gone by, if only for the moment of time it took to carry them upstairs.

I also couldn't help but think "What if I'd stayed on that particular path?", for a given collection of books. For example, as I started to get into Web Development seriously, learning guitar kind of took a back seat to that. Although I do still play, I don't put in ten hour sessions anymore. Partially due to the fact that I can't get away with three day work weeks anymore. Boo hoo for me, right? But I can't help but imagine how much more I could have progressed with the guitar had I stayed on that path.

Then there was my whole Derren Brown phase, where - after reading one of his autobiographies - I bought and read most of the books he recommended in it. I practised memorisation techniques; trying to read peoples true intentions through involuntary eye movements. I could even look through a deck of cards, with one card removed, and tell you instantly which one was missing.

But don't get me wrong, I'm not regretful of how things came to be - after all it brought me to my lovely lady. Plus it's not as though those things are gone, they just need to be awoken once again.

What things do _you_ own that trigger memories of _your_ past?
