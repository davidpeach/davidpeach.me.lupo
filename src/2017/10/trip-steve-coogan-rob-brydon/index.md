The Trip is a British TV sitcom starring Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon. In it, they play semi-fictionalised versions of themselves as they travel to various restaurants in order to review them for a paper. Each series focuses on a single country.

The story that runs through The Trip is a simple one, giving plenty of space to enjoy the conversations and natural chemistry between Steve and Rob. Often we see them talking over a gorgeous looking meal in one of the restaurants they are reviewing. These conversations then tend to snowball into an array of impressions of famous people. The impressions are hilarious too, which isn't surprising at all given the calibre of these two comedy legends.

For me, where this series really shines, is in its ability to make me feel like I'm there with them. I could just as well be on the next table over from them in the restaurant listening in.

Despite the many laughs this series has, it still has a serious thread running through it. It often explores the characters' personal side and how they may occasionally veer off the straight and narrow. These moments aren't played for laughs either; the whole show is very sincere from beginning to end. In fact the laughs that The Trip triggers are as organic as if you _were_ sat in the room with them.

The friendly rivalry between the two of them is fun to watch as well, with them having occasional digs at one another's career. There are even times when I'd think one had overstepped the mark. However, I have to remember that they are playing character versions of themselves, not their actual selves.

At the time of writing, there are three series of The Trip: 'The Trip', 'The Trip to Italy' and 'The Trip to Spain'. (The first series was set in the countryside villages in the north of England). It is such a fun series to watch one after the other, and I've never got tired of sitting with them as they eat some of the worlds best looking food.

Here's some of the moments from the series for you to taste:
