This is one of the most fascinating discussions I’ve heard in a long while. A discussion that talks about the human condition through the ideas of addiction, mixed martial arts, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and many other things between.

One of the key quotes I took from this was at [1 hour 14 minutes and 26 seconds](http://web.archive.org/web/20180219021250/https://youtu.be/iZPH6r_ZDvM?t=1h14m26s), where Joe Rogan says:

> I think there’s a freeing aspect in pushing boundaries – physical boundaries because it’s exhausting, and not just exhausting physically but mentally too because there’s a strain on your body’s desire to quit. Like your mind’s desire to seek comfort and that **in pushing past that you find this freedom and you also find a vulnerability in who you are as a person**.
