Every single regurgitated blog post I see about starting a blog always says the same thing - find a niche and focus on targeting it. This can be a toxic idea as it has the power to both limit you and paralyse you from writing.

I'm not saying you shouldn't have a focus in your writing, just don't let finding a focus stop you _from_Â writing.

My advice to anybody out there wanting to start a blog is this - just open a free WordPress.com account and get writing. I mention WordPress as it is cloud-based, free, and has the ability for you to export your posts when you are ready to move to a self-hosted solution.

**Just start writing**.

Even the process of setting up a self-hosted WordPress site can be danuting for new people, but that's okay. You shouldn't need to worry about these steps when you are just starting out.

I highly recommend that you _do_ have a self-hosted website eventually, just don't let setting one up hinder you from any writing you could actually be doing.

**You don't need to feel that you have to publish everything you write either**. Just writing for writing's sake is good for you. Obviously if you can share your thoughts and experiences with the world then that's all good, just don't feel you have to.
