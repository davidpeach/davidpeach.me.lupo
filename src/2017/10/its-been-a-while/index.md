I've not been writing as often as I'd like this last week. Partly this is due to my having done the Birmingham International Marathon last Sunday and being in recovery from a knee injury from that. But I know that's a pathetic excuse - there's always my phone that I can write posts on after all. That being said I am currently putting together a structure, a strategy if you like, for planning writing and publishing posts at a more consistent rate. Once it is all put together I'll put together a list of the programs and services I am using for it. I had a goal a few weeks back of getting to this site to have 250 published posts in total by Christmas day 2017. This post will be number 182 so I'm not sure if I'll successfully manage 250 by then. But I will give it a good try. Going to be going pumpkin picking tomorrow but don't know what I'm going to theme my pumpkin on this year. Last year's was Pinhead from Hellraiser. I'd love to hear some suggestions from you. Take care, Dave.
