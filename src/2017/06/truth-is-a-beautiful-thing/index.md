London Grammar's latest album, 'Truth is a beautiful thing' is an absolutely stunning journey of emotion and sweeping scores. I enjoyed their debut too, but this album has just completely got its hooks in me.

Hannah Reid's voice is simply stunning as she powers through the songs, at times with an air of Florence Welch to her. That, along with the atmospheric music behind her, cause me to almost lose track of time when I'm listening. Sometimes it seems like so much time has passed when in fact only two or three songs have.

The song that hooked me definitely has to be 'Hell to the liars'. Words can't describe it's beauty and the affect it continues to have on me as I keep replaying it. I'll link a video below as well as a link to buy the album.

London Grammar have quickly become one of my favourite bands in recent days and have been added to my current list of obsessions.
