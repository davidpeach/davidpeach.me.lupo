Welcome back to milk by Du Blonde is fierce, bold and packs a huge punch in its 36 minutes. Du Blonde, real name Beth Jeans Houghton takes us to many different places in this album. I’m excited to introduce you to it.

From the very opening crunching guitar riff of 'Black Flag', this album will wake you from any slumber. There’s no half-assed listening to her music with one earbud in. This album demands your full attention and I think you’ll be giving it.

'Chips to go' keeps the energy high with her occasional screaming and the super catchy guitar riff. As does the frantic assault on the senses from the later song 'Mr Hyde'.

As well as her high-energy post-punk style music, Du Blonde also slows things down beautifully in one of my favourite songs, 'Four in the morning'. With just her voice and piano, she sings with a softness, sitting in contrast to the album's more aggressive songs. It also leads perfectly into what is perhaps the most experimental song on the album, “Mind is on my mind”

'Mind is on my mind' is a song of distinct parts, all unique yet working in the most perfect harmony together. It also makes an excellent example of Beth's musical sensibilities. The best way I can describe this one is by quoting Beth herself:

> I was interested at the time in writing songs with no repeating sections, but rather a succession of acts. A couple of months later, Sam and I took a trip out to the desert and came back to LA to make some music. I played him the track and he got in the booth and ad-libbed his lyrics over the instrumentation. He was done in like one or two takes. When I was back in London I’d become obsessed with these Middle Eastern and Greek guitar scales and I added the lead guitar in the outro as a contrast to Sam’s vocals.

'Isn't it wild' is the perfect closing song for this album, after having being dropped into the blistering 'Black Flag' opening. Gorgeous strings, piano and voice being given a vintage echo. Listening to this gave me thoughts of floating gently back out of the album from whence I dropped.

Welcome back to milk has absolutely zero skippable songs, with each one holding an air of experimentation to it. Every one of these songs has been lovingly hand-crafted and come together to make an album that is truly greater than the sum of its parts.
