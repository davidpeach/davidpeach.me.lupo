I've not long got back from voting in my first ever General Election. Then after about ten minutes of trying to decide whether or not to put some money on Jeremy Corbyn to become Prime Minister, I closed the browser window - I just don't have faith in this country to put the right person in power. I really do hope I'm kicking myself tomorrow for not having put that bet on.

I've never been a politically-minded person and as such had never voted in any capacity until the Leave / Remain vote last year. This is something I have made a conscious decision to change as of this week. It really is important to get off your ass and vote for the people that you want to represent you over the following four years. Just sitting back and saying "My one vote isn't going to make a difference" or "They're all the bloody same" just isn't good enough. It's lazy and it's dangerous.

For my recent political awakening I have [Russell Brand](http://www.russellbrand.com) to thank with his [Under the Skin](https://art19.com/shows/under-the-skin) podcast and Trews video series. Him and and his guests have opened my eyes up to see past all of the sensationalist bullshit that floods the news stands every day. I also have a new appreciation for more ideas around me as well questioning things that I hear; not always taking what I hear at face value.

Here is the video of Russell Brand urging people to register to vote. In the past I had the impression that Russell was a complete idiot. He's now one of my biggest influences online as well as being one of the sanest political voices out there. Thanks Russell!

If the Conservatives gain power for the next four years, I believe that this country will enter a spiral into an abyss of fear, eroded human rights and regret.
