No TV show goes to places in the way that Twin Peaks does, or indeed even did when its first series aired.

I'm not talking about level of graphic violence or any sort of shock factor; I'm talking sheer originality. Twin Peaks always has been, and always will be, completely original. From the unique collaboration of David Lynch and Mark Frost, this series has such a depth of story, location, and character that it is a place I'd love to live in real life - even when it's completely terrifying.

When people keep talking about the default shows - namely Game of Thrones at the time of writing, I can't help but roll my eyes a little. I mean, don't get me wrong, I really like Game of Thrones, but nothing gets under my skin quite like Twin Peaks does. I try to describe it in a way to get other people into it too. I find it hard to put into words but I try. It's like that feeling of butterflies in your stomach when there's a huge moment of realisation or connection between characters and / or events. Of course many other series have those reveals, but I honestly don't think any other show does it in quite the same way.

Anyone who has seen some of David Lynch's films should know what I mean about his unique style. He has a certain vision and confidence in that vision to bring truly unique stories, visuals and sounds to the screen. This is no different in the new series of Twin Peaks. If anything his years of cinema between the original series and now, have in the very least strengthened his confidence in his vision.

Twin Peaks has evolved into 100% unfiltered David Lynch, based on the ideas of both Lynch and Frost, and I fucking love it.
