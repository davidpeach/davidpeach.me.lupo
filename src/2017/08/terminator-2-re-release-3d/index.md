When I was eight years old Terminator 2: Judgement Day was released at the cinema. I remember it vividly. Not because of my going to see it, but because of the evening my parents dropped me off at my Nan's house whilst _they_ went to watch it.

Now, Twenty Six years later, I finally had the opportunity to see it on the big screen myself.

## I was initially skeptical

When the announcement was made about the retro fitting of 3D for its re-release I was disappointed. I've never been much of a fan of 3D cinema and simply wanted to see this film as it was originally. I grew up watching this all the time; memorised all the lines; and even played out the scenes with friends in junior school. I was obsessed to say the least. This is one of my favourite films, if not my actual favourite film, and was worried it would somehow tarnish my love of it.

However, if this was to be my first chance to see Terminator 2 on the big screen I was gonna take it.

## I was not disappointed

As soon as the film began I was immediately blown away. The Terminator's skull coming out of the fire at the end of the opening credits was so spectacular-looking and was completely terrifying. The moment had finally came - I was about to see Terminator 2 on the big screen.

All throughout the film I found myself noticing more of the background details, probably through a conscious effort to absorb the full 3D effect. Even in the T-1000's arrival, I would be noticing all of the wrecked cars and debris in the underpass. I got even more wrapped up in this world than I had previously done.

Everything I loved about this film was magnified up on the screen.

## The Special Effects still hold up today

Twenty six years after this film released, then ahead of it's time, the special effects still hold up strongly. The highway chase between the police van and helicopter still looked great - greatly due to the fact it was all filmed for real. No C.G. shots back then, kids. Even the nightmare hydrogen bomb scene, even more horrifying at a huge size, still had all the power of its first outing. In fact I couldn't help get more of an emotional connection to this in the light of recent threats and actions in the news by certain heads of state douche bags.

## Thank you, Jim

A big thanks to James Cameron and all of the people who went into making this re-release a reality. Let's hope there's enough interest to warrant the possibly-next-planned remaster, Aliens.
