I've just been reading about how a decision today could potentially lead to the end of SoundCloud. The company has just been saved by a couple of investors but still may be gone very soon.

I've discovered some great artists through SoundCloud and will be somewhat saddened if / when it does indeed die.

It also makes me think whether or not I could create a similar service to take it's place. I know there is Spotify and Google Play et al, but those just don't seem to me to have the same heart as SoundCloud.
