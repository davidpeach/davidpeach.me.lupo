I'm finding I'm taking my blog way too seriously. Instead of just writing; checking; and publishing, I'm leaving posts in draft worried they are not professional enough.

This is stupid.

This website is for me and me alone. I'm currently writing (have written) a long post about my experience with playing Life is Strange and I'm too busy trying to make it sound like a professional review to actually publish it.

From a couple of podcasts I've listened to recently I have found this is a common issue for bloggers.

I'm going to do my very best to not censor or judge myself too much. Instead I'm gonna do my very best to just get writing every single day.

In this spirit I'm not going to proof read this post - instead I'm just gonna press publish...  
...now.
