Tomorrow night I finally get to see one of my favourite, if not my actual favourite, film of all time - Terminator 2: Judgement Day. My only initial concern / worry is that it's being released in 3D.

I don't like to be a hater for the sake of hating, but I'm always sceptical about films shown in 3D. Maybe I've just had bad experiences but the only film I remember being impressed by was Tron: Legacy. Avatar was an enjoyable film but the 3D gave me a headache. Maybe I was just ill anyway.

So I'm really looking forward to seeing T2 on the big screen - 3D or however - after having had it as the most memorable film of my growing up. I remember it coming out in 1991 - I was 8 - and my parents dropping me off at my Nan's while they went to watch it on release. It feels like life has come full circle somewhat, now that I get to watch it up there.

I'll write up my complete thoughts on the experience once I've seen it. I may even go for a double bill with War for the Planet of the Apes afterwords.
