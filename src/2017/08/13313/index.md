There's an electricity in the air today; thunder and lightning and a quick downpour has recharged the air outside. I often prefer the weather like this when at home - there's something about being indoors when outside is like that.

Of course a lot of people have no choice but to be out in that sort of weather.

**Please consider donating to [Homeless Link](http://www.homeless.org.uk/about-us/donate) today.**

p.s. This post started off as just a quick personal note; a status update. However, in the course of writing those two paragraphs it made me think of other things. This in turn led to my seeking out, discovering and linking to Homeless Link. If nothing else, this has confirmed that I really should be writing every day - for myself; not just for any potential readers.

And if I can help others along the way then that's an added bonus
