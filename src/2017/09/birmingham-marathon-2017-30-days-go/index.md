Today's run left me feeling a lot more confident for the upcoming marathon than the previous Sunday's. Last Sunday I attempted this route but ran on an empty stomach which, amongst other factors, caused me to stop at the 8.3 mile mark.

This time I made sure I had a good meal one hour before running as well as being hydrated. Also I took one of my new energy gels with me to have one hour into the race. I think it worked. I mean, I didn't feel a boost of energy or anything like that, but I did stay at the same level of tiredness throughout the run.

Finishing this run left me feeling a lot more confident, but I still have no illusions about the marathon itself - it's gonna be a killer. If I had kept to my original training regime I should be running a 22 mile distance today. I ran half that.

You can see my run results [here](https://www.strava.com/activities/1186812871/shareable_images/map_based?hl=en-US&v=1505579355) if you want. I think next weekend I may go for a 15 mile distance but I think that'll be the furthest I do before the actual day, for fear of injuring myself.
