Don't talk to me about any old history,  
war or enemy troops advancing  
Nor any-of-me roots or fencing  
Cuz I'm not in a garden; I'm not planting  

Yer cuz I've got a plan ting  
It don't just boil down to a woman or a man ting  
If my head is in my hands, I ain't distracted  
Man's just focused; concentrating.  

I just focus on the here and now,  
You just focus on your beer and chow.  
Every night I'll be head down; working  
Every night you'll be pants down; jerking
