The lady herself has returned and not a moment too soon. Lorde’s debut album “Heroine” is up there as one of my favourite ever albums and have been waiting eagerly for her follow up. This first single, “Green Light”, from her next album has a different sound to her debut – more up-tempo.

I have read comments already from people either loving it or moaning that it sounds too “generic pop”. Lorde is such a unique force within the music scene today, that her fans are perhaps scared that she’ll lose her idiosyncrasies. While I do understand their concerns, let’s not forget that she’s a young artist and it’s her right to try new things. Also it would have been easy for her to release “Heroine 2” and give her fans more of the same. But she is pushing herself forwards and trying new things. This song is growing on me, and I’m excited to hear what the full offering is on her sophomore album.
