As soon as this track started I was immediately transported back to the 80’s.

The synth sounds in the opening felt like something from The Terminator soundtrack.Then the thumping beat kicks in and I was hooked.

The first time I heard this was from watching the accompanying music video, and I’m glad it was. The video is one of the most powerful music videos I’ve seen in a long time. And at less than three minutes long, it’s bursting at the seams with energy and style.
