I seem to keep running around in circles looking for the perfect side project to work on. I just cant decide on which direction to go - and once I think I have I'll end up doubting myself and changing my mind soon after.

I am a Web Developer by trade and, like many other developers, love the idea of having some sort of side project I can work on and potential earn a second income off.

I guess that's one of the reasons I keep writing on here, my personal site. It sort of _is_ a side project, except one that I'm not building as such - merely writing on it every now and again.

I don't even know why I'm writing this post to be honest with you. It's sort of me working it out in my head as I write, in a vein effort to try and make a decision.

Even if I do make a decision I'll probably change it soon after. Also it's possible that... damn my dinner's burning!
