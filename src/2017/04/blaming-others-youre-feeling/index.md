## Starting the day in a down sort of way

Feeling out of sorts, for whatever reason, is never a nice thing - especially when it's the first day back at work after a four dayÂ Easter weekend. This is how I found myself today. It didn't help the fact that I'd had nothing to eat either until 7pm, except for a sausage roll from Greggs. This wasn't out of being too busy or choice; I simply didn't feel hungry. As a result of my mood and lack of food I ended up feeling lackluster and hazy.

## Reflecting back through the day

On reflection, during the train journey back home, I replayed certain points of the day and realized just how much of an ass I must have come across. I mean, I pretty much kept to myself and just cracked on with my work. But when I discovered someone had played an innocent prank on me I think I took it a little bit to heart. Miserable bastard, I think the term is. There were other little moments too, which I wont go into specifics about, but let me just say that I was a bit of a "cranky-pants", as my lady would say. I can only put it down to a mixture of a lack of sleep the night before, lack of food and knowing that my hamster Moomin is approaching the end of his little life.

## Do better next time

This is no excuse however. I can simply learn from this and do better moving forward. I write this not only because I have promised myself I'll blog every single day for a year, but in case there are any other people out there with similar experiences. This life is, if nothing more, a string of experiences and knowing that others have similar issues from time to time can help us all through.
