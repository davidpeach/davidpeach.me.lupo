[Mulholland Drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulholland_Drive_(film)) is a dream i often like to get lost in. It is one of my top five films and is a film where i am happy to be led into the darkness of David Lynch's genius.

A friend of mine and me were lucky enough to get tickets to the first showing of the newly-restored version of this film as part of Birmingham's flatpack festival.

It was everything i imagined and hoped it would be. Key scenes were even more powerful on the big screen; Rebecca Del Rio's a cappella version of Crying; the leading up the secret path; Betty's audition with Woody Catz.

Not only was it immersive _behind_ the screen, but so too was the crowd that i found myself fortunate to sit with. This was the first time in all my cinema-going history where i have taken part in a full-on applauding for the film in both it's starting and finishing.

The trip back home proved annoying as my main route was closed and had to follow diversions for an extra half an hour. My arriving home at half twelve in the morning didn't mark the end of my day however. You see, it was also the day of the Prison Break season 5 premiere and I wasn't gonna miss this one for the world.

I enjoyed the new episode. Of course it didn't have the wow factor that the revealing of the tattoos did at the end of season one's premiere, but i guess it's hard to recapture that. I wasn't disappointed though. I enjoyed seeing the old characters back and look forward to seeing where their paths take them.
