After my initial moan about being confronted with [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) yesterday, today i have actually been looking into it - learning it in order to get the job I've been tasked with finished.

I don't know why, but i tend to get that gut reaction most times i am confronted by something foreign to me. I think it may stem from a frustration of not knowing something and then, within a work context, worrying about how long it's going to take me.

No running tonight, which I'm thankful for. My thighs are aching slightly from yesterday's 2.5 kilometre jog. Yes, I'm _that_ unfit. It's hard to think that I'm actually going to be doing a full Marathon in October - or at least attempting it.

At the time of writing this, I've just seen a guy wearing a gym training hoody that reads "Train Hard, Fight Easy". I'm not sure it's wise walking around Birmingham with that printed on your top. You're just asking for trouble from those looking for a fight, surely?
