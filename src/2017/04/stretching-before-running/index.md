One of the annoying things about web development, is having to learn completely new paradigms every now and again. I'm all for improving my skills and being more efficient in my work, but when i have to halt to have to learn a whole new separate thing, it grinds my gears a bit.

The idea I'm talking about today is something called [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/). Yet another data access methodology and one that I've never had to mess with before. Don't get me wrong I'm not hating on the technology, I would simply rather not have to learn this whole new way of searching data.

I'm easily confused.

On a more positive note i have started taking steps towards actually building my first online product / service which i think could be very handy for a lot, if not all, bloggers. It's something I built for myself and thought about how others could benefit from it too.  
Stay tuned for more info as it develops.

Tonight I've been enrolled into a run up the canal by my lady. Although i felt a sudden drive for it this morning, that has since passed after my tiring over one of the most boring tutorial videos I've ever watched - about the aforementioned Elasticsearch. I'm sure she won't let me shirk my running responsibilities and I'll be jogging round the block in no time.
