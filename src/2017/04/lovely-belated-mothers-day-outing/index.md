Today I took my mom to [Middleton Hall](http://www.middleton-hall.co.uk/) for the afternoon and had a great time. After lunch in the small cafe, within the old stables, we ventured around the Hall itself and surrounding gardens.

It's amazing how much interesting history is right there on your doorstep. For example the Middleton estate was leased to the Knight's Templar in 1185 by the owners at the time, the de Marmion family.

Also one of the commanders at the largest naval battle of World War One, [The Battle of Jutland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jutland), was from the Willoughby family. The Willoughby family owned the Middleton estate for about 500 years.

Those are just two snippets but you can find out more [on their website](http://www.middleton-hall.co.uk/home/estate/). Also one of the ladies working there was very knowledgeable on the whole subject. She gave us loads of facts and figures but I can't lie - there was simply too much to take in during one sitting. But very helpful nonetheless.
