Leading on from the series' opener, [Witching Time](https://davidpeach.co.uk/2017/11/witching-time-hammer-house-of-horror-episode-1/), is the second episode of the eighties British anthology series [Hammer House of Horror](https://davidpeach.co.uk/tag/hammer-house-of-horror/). The Thirteenth Reunion is a step away from the supernatural - perhaps consciously so in order to display the show's diversity.

## What's The Thirteenth Reunion about?

Ruth is a newspaper reporter who has been stuck reporting on the mundane for too long. As part of her job, she is sent to a nearby health retreat called "Think Thin". The owner has some questionable encouragement methods and she is sent to get the story.

During her first day she meets Ben, a well to do banker who dies that evening. His death occurs soon after taking a slimming pill that was given to him by the clinic. Although she is initially shocked at the news of his death, Ruth wastes no time in turning the suspected foul-play to her advantage. The advantage being the possibility of breaking a potentially big news story on her own.

She is approached at Ben's funeral by the director, who suspects his bosses of being up to something shady with some of the bodies - Ben's included. She takes this opportunity to team up with the funeral director to investigate his bosses' strange goings on. These events set Ruth on her passage of exploration that ultimately lead her to an unforgettable twist ending that will leave you open-mouthed long after the credits roll.

## The horror is not knowing

There is no way to talk about the closing ten minutes of this episode without ruining it for you. What I will say is that you wont see it coming, not the full story at least.

All the way through this episode we are kept in the dark almost as much as Ruth is. We do get to see _some_ of the interactions between shady characters that she doesn't, but never enough to give the game away.

The Thirteenth Reunion is an episode that plays its cards very close to its chest. The majority of the episode is pretty standard investigative journalist stuff and it isn't until the final few minutes that the real horror begins. And the majority of that horror is not in what it chooses to show you, but in what it chooses _not_ to.
