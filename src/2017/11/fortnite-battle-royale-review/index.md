## What is a “Battle Royale” game?

Battle Royale refers to a particular style of game where every player is trying to kill all other players. It is a last person standing all-out war. Typically, all players will land on different places across a large island and hurry to find weapons and survive longer than all other players.

Battle Royale style games have become popular recently with [H1Z1](https://www.h1z1.com/home) and more recently [Playerunknown's Battlegrounds](https://playbattlegrounds.com/main.pu). And now we have Fortnite Battle Royale, which has enough of its own unique selling points to warrant it being accepted amongst the others.

## What makes Fortnite Battle Royale stand out amongst similar games?

Firstly, pretty much the whole of the map is destructible, except for the ground you walk on. You start each game with a huge pickaxe, with which you are able to break things down to their base parts. For example, buildings and trees can be chopped away into blocks of wood, walls can be smashed into bricks, and storage containers can be broken into metal. But what to do with these materials? Well, that leads me on to my next unique point.

Anywhere across the island, you are able to use any building materials you gather to build your own structures. These structures can give you an edge in a firefight, shielding you from enemy fire. They can also help you get up to higher places, such as building lofts, where higher grade weapons could be hiding.

A welcome difference for me with this game was its ease of learning. All weapons that are scattered across the map are standalone, meaning you don’t need to faff around finding addons. The weapons increase in power as their colours go from weakest to strongest: Gray, Green, Blue, Purple and Orange. So if you spot a weapon that is a higher grade color to your own, grab it! Also there is no scavenging for different tiers of armour - you can find armour potions that will give extra protection once drank, but that’s about it.

## Fortnite looks beautiful

Fortnite is such an attractive game to watch. It's bubbly, colourful characters and surroundings act as a gorgeous veneer to hide what is still a brutal and intense game. When I first saw its visual style I couldn't help but think that Disney had made a game.

All of the locations are gorgeous to walk around and explore too. The areas aren't too big or too small, they feel just right with a comfortable distance between them. From the dark and gloomy 'Wailing Woods' to the open space 'Loot Lake' in the centre of the map, each area has it's own feel to it. My personal favourite is the 'Lonely Lodge' on the east coast and its nearby watch tower - a great sniping position.

Everything down to the finer details impressed me in this game. Like even how the health points pop up on an enemy to display how much damage you've done. Or the animations when someone is killed and their loot bounces out of them. It's just all so playful and fun.

## Anatomy of each game

Once the game’s home screen is loaded up, it has been taking me an average of around thirty seconds to a minute to begin a match. Sometimes even quicker. After the few moments in the holding area while the server fills with players, you are immediately taken to the hot-air balloon powered battle bus over the island. This flying bus is everyone’s starting position as it flies over the battleground island from one side to the other. At any point whilst going over the island you are able to jump out and free-fall down to the surface.

Once you land on the surface you must first find a weapon to defend yourself with. Weapons come in a variety of classes, which are grouped together by colour. Not only weapons, but you can also collect armour potions, traps and medikits for self-healing. But that’s about it. One of the beauties of this game, as mentioned before, is it's simplicity. It makes the whole concept of surviving really enjoyable.

After a few moments of landing on the ground, a white circle appears on the game map to designate the next safe zone. You then have three minutes to get within that zone as the deep purple, violent storm approaches. If you remain in the storm clouds they will quickly zap down your health and you will soon die. The deadly storm continues to push all surviving players into the same ever-decreasing safe zone until there is only one player left standing.

## In Summary

Fortnite is a super fun and addictive game to play. Each match is pretty quick, lasting a maximum of around fifteen minutes (if you last until the final few). This was also a lot more simple for me to get up to speed with than other Battle Royale games.

This game makes for a very enjoyable and attractive experience of survival. Fortnite Battle Royale is no less intense than similar games of its kind but in my honest opinion, its the one that is the most fun.
