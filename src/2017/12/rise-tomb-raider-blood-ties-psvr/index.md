Rise of the Tomb Raider Blood Ties came with the base game as part of the [Tomb Raider 20 year celebration](http://amzn.to/2CF3Y94). I have previously written about my love for [Rise of the Tomb Raider](https://davidpeach.me/2017/11/08/thoughts-on-rise-of-the-tomb-raider/). However, I was not prepared for just how amazing the Blood Ties DLC would be in [PlayStation VR](https://davidpeach.me/tag/playstation-vr/).

## The same blood ties story

Blood Ties on PlayStation VR is the same story as the normal version. The only difference is that you get to see through the eyes of Lara Croft in the fully immersive environment of Croft Manor. And wow - what a difference it makes. I loved the DLC as it was - I had bought it originally on Steam and played it straight through. But my first job with any new console is always to buy a Tomb Raider game. So with my PlayStation 4 Pro, I bought Rise of the Tomb Raider 20th year celebration.

The story line has you exploring the manor in order to find her father's will. Her uncle, Atlas, claims ownership over the manor and so Ms Croft must uncover the will in order to save it. The insights into Lara's past are interesting as you explore the various areas of the manor. I particularly found the mention of [locking the butler, Winston, in the fridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4S8X-5yDlHg) particularly funny. This was a reference to the popular past time for many players of both Tomb Raider 2 and 3.

Also worth mentioning is the gramophone that you can turn on in the library. This will then trigger the playing of the popular [Venice theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWsICxqgt5w) from Tomb Raider 2. Written by the hugely talented [Nathan McCree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_McCree).

## You can taste the rain

Standing in the main foyer of Croft Manor is still one of my favourite things to do on PlayStation VR. Looking around at the beautiful architecture then up to the hole in the vaulted ceiling, I could almost taste the rain coming in. Just standing atop of the bookcases, looking down at the library, just fills me with awe at what the game developers have achieved with this DLC.

The story will take you to all the corners of the manor. Each and every nook and cranny pulled me in for closer inspection. The most atmospheric area for me was the cellar. Not only was the use of the PlayStation controller to control the flashlight highly effective, but I could feel Lara's trepidation exploring these lower regions of the manor. If I didn't already know what happens in this DLC, I'd have been scared walking around down there.

## Levels of comfort

Like with many of the PlayStation VR releases, there are different levels of comfort available when playing through Blood Ties. The big one is the two options of movement. You can either use the teleport function, which is enabled by default, or use the free roaming option.

### Teleport

Using the teleport option allows you to use the controller to gesture on screen where you want Lara to jump to. She doesn't physically jump there, but there is a smooth use of a fade between the start and end point. If you are worried about motion sickness then this is the best option for you.

### Free roaming

Free roaming is just as it sounds - free walking about the manor in the first-person perspective. This is so awesome to experience, however, I did begin to get motion sickness when I would turn one way whilst glancing around another. It was a similar feeling to when I would read a book in a moving car when I was a child. It is definitely worth trying out this option for a short time though - or longer if you can handle it.

## In Summary

Rise of the Tomb Raider Blood Ties is absolutely effing incredible in PlayStation VR. In fact, it was incredible anyway - the VR aspect just enhances it to the nth degree. There really is no feeling like being Lara Croft for a while, wandering around the derelict halls uncovering her family story.

I am really looking forward to [the next Tomb Raider game that was just announced](http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/games/tomb-raider/53896/tomb-raider-square-enix-announces-next-game-in-the-series). I am praying that the developers come up with even more exciting and awe-inspiring ways of incorporating the PlayStation VR experience into Lara's world in her next adventure.
