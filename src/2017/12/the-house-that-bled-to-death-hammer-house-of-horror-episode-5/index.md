The House That Bled to Death kicks off strong and stays strong throughout its 50 minutes. It keeps a sustained anxiousness until it's very final scenes.

## What is 'The house that bled to death about?

The darkest and coldest opening of the series so far. An elderly couple are together in the kitchen about to have a cup of warm milk before bed. The husband heats the milk and slips a dark powder into one of the cups. As he sits there and lets his wife drink the tainted milk, not a word is exchanged. We have no idea as to why he is murdering his wife and in the world of [Hammer House of Horror](https://davidpeach.co.uk/tag/hammer-house-of-horror/) it doesn't really matter.

Fast forward some time ahead and we are with this episode's family, the Peters family. They are buying the very same house where the murder occurred, unknowing to them, from one of the creepiest estate agents in a TV series ever. As soon as they begin moving in, strange things start happening - doors jamming, strange visions and the most gruesome death of an animal I've seen in the series thus far.

As they try to bare the strange goings on in the house, tensions are increased both within the family and with the neighbours and friends. The poltergeist-like happenings culminate with the most shocking child's Birthday party I've ever seen. But just when you think it's all over, we see one of the most interesting - in my opinion - closing scenes of an episode of Hammer House of Horror I've watched.

## I wonder about the child actors

Every time I see these sorts of series or films I can't help but wonder how the children are affected. I mean, obviously if there's a dead body the child wouldn't necessarily need to physically see it. Through the magic of editing this effect can be produced. But when you have a scene such as this episode's Birthday party, where the children are directly affected, this must be an awkward conversation with the young actorsâ€™ parents.

Nonetheless the child actors do a really good job in this episode. Their terror is almost palpable - which is worrying on a couple of levels. Sometimes I find the younger actors more convincing than their superiors. This could simply be down to the fact that children, in their very nature, are innocent. So the horrors that befall them are that much more horrific.

## In Summary

Definitely one of the strongest and most memorable episodes of the Hammer House of Horror TV series. The House That Bled To Death has everything you could want from a hammer horror series.

The feeling of claustrophobia is maintained throughout most of the episode from being limited to the interior of their house. The house too is not a house that would necessarily stand out. You would see many houses like it passing through most built up city suburbs. This in itself is scary. The fact that it isn't some huge eerie castle or dark, set-back mansion. This is a regular house, for regular families, who have to endure some far-from-regular things.
