[Lady Wood](https://davidpeach.co.uk/2016/11/lady-wood-by-tove-lo/) was one of my favourite albums from last year and still gets regular plays in my headphones. I was excited to say the least when I heard about Tove Lo's follow-up Blue Lips \[Lady Wood Phase 2\].

## A continuation of Lady Wood

This album felt more akin to the sweaty underground night clubs I imagine with her music. The kind of clubs where people are pressed tightly together; almost tasting each other's sweat. The previous album had these moments but Blue Lips felt like these aesthetics were brought more into the foreground. The album's intro and following lead single, 'Disco Tits', gave me the impression that a more deep bass / drum-driven collection of songs were contained.

There was a song from [Tove Lo's short film Fairy Dust](https://davidpeach.co.uk/2016/11/tove-los-short-film-fairy-dust/), specifically the closing scene... _that_ closing scene, that I didn't recognise at the time. So I loved it when that very song, 'bitches',  came punching through my headphones to close off this album's first half.

## It's not all boom boom boom

Although I like a good punchy beat-driven album now and again, I was relieved when I heard 'Don't ask don't tell', the album's fifth track. It's proof that she knows, as she sings on Disco Tits, how to dial it back. 'Don't ask don't tell' is more focused on her beautiful vocals and the direct message of acceptance she's delivering to her other half in the song.

> And baby, don't ask, then don't tell  
> Already know you're fucked up  
> And it's cool with me  
> My past and don't ask and don't tell  
> No need to share too much  
> Come on, let it be, ah (and baby)
> 
> dont ask dont tell - Tove Lo

This feeling is continued later in the album with the reminiscent '9th of October', which actually started life as a poem that Tove wrote on her Birthday. This, along with the album's closing track, 'hey you got drugs?', are two of my favourite songs from the album.

## NSFW (not safe for work)

As I've come to expect from Tove Lo's work, there is a high degree of sexual content in these songs. She's definitely an artist who goes to places that other artists I listen to don't. She's not afraid of exposing herself, both physically and mentally, for her art and I respect that. I say that, not as a pervy guy just looking for filth, but as someone in admiration for her honesty and close to the bone approach to music.

Singers often sing about sadness; happiness; fear; love. But very rarely do they venture into the realms of the sexual. This too is an important part of what it means to be human, so why shouldn't artists explore these issues too? Tove Lo seems to make up for the more reserved artists by spending a good portion of her album there.

## In Summary

As great an album as I have come to expect from Tove, following her Lady Wood. Blue Lips is the continuation of her exploration and revelations in her relationships and the emotions they bring. Although I didn't find this album as accessible initially, I still love to listen to it when the mood hits me right. And don't take me to mean less accessible as a bad thing - it's not. I just find Lady Wood a lot easier to listen to at any time, whereas Blue lips has its time and place for me.
