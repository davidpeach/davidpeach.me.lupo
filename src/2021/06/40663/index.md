Dead by Daylight -- Resident Evil chapter

Seriously can not wait for this chapter of DBD on the 15th June.

Resident Evil 2 Remake and Resident Evil 3 remake have been two of my favourite games of the past few years -- especially when re-playing.

So to get this in my go-to multiplayer game, Dead By Daylight, is like birthday and Christmas at once.
