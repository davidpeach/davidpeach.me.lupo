Release in 2004, this is one of my favourite albums from my younger days.

Thanks to a work mate, my love for this band has been re-ignited. I have been listened to their albums lots over the past couple of weeks, but this one has stood out to me above most.

Possibly helped along from the nostalgia I feel for this album.

## Stand out songs for me

- Track 2 -- Gilded Cunt

- Track 3 -- Nemesis

- Track 5 -- Nymphetamine overdose
