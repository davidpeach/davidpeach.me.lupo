You know what? Fuck Google. Just when I think I couldn't hate them more. Exporting my previous uploaded music (about 100gb worth) from their Play Music service. Do they put the songs into Artist / Album folders?

Nope.

Instead they package it up into 54 zipped folders and stick random songs along with loads of csv files with dumb stats in.

Seriously.

Now I'll have to write a little script to read the song meta data and organise into folders myself.

I'll share the script once it's done and tested.
