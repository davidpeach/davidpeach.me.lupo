I have recently completed my blog’s style overhaul. Although not completely finished, the bulk is done.

To be done:

- Logo

- ‘Memorable Places’ section on the about page

- Comment Form

- Page Footer

I am super happy with how it has turned out, and have no desire to change it as I have with my past attempts.

The past couple of weeks I have been setting myself up on various social applications such as Flickr, tumblr and dribbble, in an attempt to become more active and creative on the web.

I am currently working on my fourth web site which will be my first proper ‘web app’. It’s a cross-device, responsive drawing web app that works in the browser. I have seen lots of great proofs of concept with html5 canvas drawing and a few awesome native apps, but wanted to see if I could build a truly cross-device drawing app that would all run right in the browser.

I anticipate it to be about a month before I release it on it’s own domain as a full stand alone web application.

Over the next couple of days I’ll be re-writing the entries from my old blog, making them a lot more comprehensive than before. I then plan to write at least one entry a week, possibly two.

The main focus of my blog is to share web development knowledge as I learn it, but will be writing off topic entries from time to time also.

For all those reading this and for any people in the future who come across my blog, thank you for you support.

Dave.
