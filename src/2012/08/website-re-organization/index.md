Hey people. I have decided to move all of my personal details from this blog and into a personal, smaller website.

I plan to keep this blog up still, but have it completely focused on web development.

My ‘about me’, ‘social links’, ‘work’ and ‘contact’ will be removed and moved to davidpeach.co.uk.

In time I may give this blog a standalone name of its own and ultimately host my personal blog on this current url. All in all a bit of a faff but think it’ll be better in the long run.

Take it easy!

Dave.
